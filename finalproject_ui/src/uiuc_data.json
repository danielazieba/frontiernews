In order to enable this revolution, however, advancements in foundational research and workforce development must first take place to provide assured and safe performance.\nThe University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has allocated $2.1 million in funds to create a new\u00a0Center for Autonomy\u00a0that will enable high-impact research and develop new educational programs for students and professionals. The center, which will include four Illinois Computer Science faculty and colleagues from across campus, will play an important role in designing innovative systems that can function without human intervention in a safe and reliable way. In addition, the\u00a0College of Engineering\u00a0is providing a $2.1 million match to recruit new faculty in robotics to continue growing expertise at Illinois.\n\u201cWe have achieved some measure of autonomy already,\u201d said the Coordinated Science Lab\u2019s\u00a0Geir E. Dullerud,\u00a0the W. Grafton and Lillian B. Wilkins Professor of\u00a0Mechanical Science and Engineering, who is the director of the new center. \u201cHowever, there\u2019s a difference between a self-driving car that works most of this time and a self-driving car that works all of the time. When it comes to safety-critical activities, we need to be assured that autonomous systems will function in the intended way.\u201d\nExperimental space for autonomy and robotics research is set to increase four-fold with the creation of the center, with the goal of applying fundamental theoretical advances to applications of the future.\nIllinois CS faculty who are part of the new center are: Associate Professor Derek Hoiem, Professor Alexander Kirlik, Research Assistant Professor Sibin Mohan, and Donald B. Gillies Chair in Computer Science Lui Sha.\nThe Center for Autonomy\u2019s researchers are already pursuing distributed autonomous and robotic trustworthy systems (DARTS) for applications that are important to humanity and our economy, such as the farm of the future, information-rich IoT-driven autonomous manufacturing floors, and defensive systems that bring humans and robots together in operational teams that are unparalleled in their capacity to defend our nation. As part of this process, researchers will advance knowledge in artificial intelligence, robotics, digital hardware, and communications.\nThe center will also galvanize thinking on many critical issues associated with autonomous systems, such as:\n\nExploring the ethical considerations of using autonomous systems and the value judgements that these machines will make, potentially without human intervention,\nExpanding and modifying the law, business, and labor models to deal with such systems in the public domain and workplace,\nAnd understanding the psychological impact of these developments on humanity.\n\nIn addition to research, the center will develop new degree programs in autonomy and robotics, which would help prepare the next generation of students to tackle critical problems in this field. The first effort will be a master\u2019s degree that will help students develop a holistic view of the issues pertinent to autonomous systems. There will also be opportunities for individuals to further focus on business, societal, and ethical dimensions. In addition, Dullerud and his colleagues plan to develop specialization certificates that would tackle similar issues.\nThe Center for Autonomy will build on the University of Illinois\u2019 established track record in autonomy. The university was recently named No. 1 in Automation & Control by the Shanghai Ranking Consultancy\u2019s Academic Ranking of World Universities.\nThe Center is funded through the competitive\u00a0Investment for Growth\u00a0program, sponsored by the Provost\u2019s office.\n\u201cBeyond our\u00a0world-renowned research and contributions to control,\u00a0autonomous systems,\u00a0IoT\u00a0and Big Data analytics,\u00a0it is\u00a0the excellence and breadth of\u00a0our community\u2019s interest in\u00a0human-centric innovations and applications of technology\u00a0that\u00a0make us stand out,\u201d said\u00a0Provost Andreas Cangellaris. \u201cIllinois\u00a0will\u00a0advance\u00a0this field\u00a0for the benefit of humanity and society in\u00a0the coming decades.\u201d\n"}, {"source": "University of Illinois", "title": "Illinois CS Professor Gul Agha Named ACM Fellow ", "link": "/news/illinois-cs-professor-gul-agha-named-acm-fellow", "date": "12/6/2018", "content": "\nGul Agha, professor of computer science, has been named a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery. ACM Fellows are composed of an elite group that represents less than one percent of the Association\u2019s global membership. ACM will formally recognize its 2018 Fellows at the annual Awards Banquet in San Francisco on June 15, 2019.\nAgha, the Director of the Open Systems Laboratory at the University of Illinois and a faculty member in the College of Engineering\u2019s City Scholars program, is cited for \u201cresearch in concurrent programming and formal methods, specifically the Actor Model.\u201d His widely cited work, \"Actors: A Model of Concurrent Computing in Distributed Systems,\" provided a basis for a number of research projects in concurrent programming. Actor frameworks such as Scala/Akka, Erlang and Microsoft Orleans have been used to program Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook Chat, the British National Health Service Portal, and hundreds of commercial cloud applications.\nResults of his research promise to lead to new ways for building and maintaining open distributed systems. Specifically, Agha's group is developing concurrent programming languages and systems which support applications with high-performance, fault-tolerance or real-time requirements.\nAgha said he was humbled by the recognition, and thankful for the research environment he has enjoyed at the University of Illinois since he joined the faculty in 1989.\n\u201cIt reflects well on the environment at Illinois, the different collaborations over the last 30 years. It really reflects the ability to flourish in an intellectually stimulating environment with great colleagues and students,\u201d he said. \u201cThe major strength of Illinois is the collaborative atmosphere, that collegial strength.\u201d\nAgha has pioneered research in an approach he calls statistical model checking with applications in diverse areas such as biological systems and cyberphysical systems.\u00a0 He also developed new logics and algorithms for quantitative model checking of aggregate properties of systems.\n\u201cThe idea is to look the behavior of systems in the aggregate and behavior you can approximate. In a large scale system a lot of the behavior will be statistical in nature,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we did is to combine statistical methods with logical methods so your specifications can be expressed precisely.\u201d\nAgha\u2019s group developed methods to automatically verify distributed systems during execution using decentralized monitoring.\u00a0 It also developed novel methods to test programs using dynamic memory and concurrency. Those methods have been incorporated in popular software testing tools such as KLEE, Microsoft SAGE, and S2E, and widely used in companies including Micro Focus Fortify, NVIDIA, and IBM, and by numerous security companies to find security vulnerabilities.\nAgha, together with B.F. Spencer, Jr., professor of civil and environmental engineering at Illinois, is co-director of the Illinois Structural Health Monitoring Group. The project pioneered research applying wireless sensor networks and distributed computing to continuously monitor the structural health of civil infrastructure such as bridges.\u00a0 The project implemented the world's largest sensor network with over 700 sensors on the Jindo bridge. The technology has also been used to monitor the world largest Ferris wheel during its construction in Dubai--the first time such monitoring was done.\u00a0 Agha is a Founder of Embedor Technologies, which is transferring the technology to the real-world.\nProfessor Agha earned a PhD in computer and communications science from the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor in 1985. After a four-year stint as a research scientist and lecturer at MIT, he joined Illinois. He has advised 30 PhD and 16 MS theses at Illinois. His advisees include professors at universities such as the University of California at Berkeley, Rochester Polytechnic Institute, and UC Irvine. Others have gone to industry, including two vice presidents at Google, a vice president and general manager at Goldman-Sachs, and several other successful entrepreneurs--one of whom was a founder of Netscape.\nAgha is currently editor-in-chief of Computing Now, which covers emerging technologies.\u00a0Previously, he was editor-in-chief of ACM Computing Surveys from 2000 to 2007, a major cross-cutting journal in computer science, and editor-in-chief of IEEE Parallel and Distributed Technology.\n\u00a0\n"}, {"source": "University of Illinois", "title": "Hutter's Work On Communication Costs Leads to DOE Computational Science Graduate Fellowship ", "link": "/news/hutters-work-communication-costs-leads-doe-computational-science-graduate-fellowship", "date": "12/4/2018", "content": "\nAs an undergraduate student in computer engineering, Edward Hutter didn\u2019t just get by in an advanced graduate-level course on communication-cost analysis. He excelled, according to Assistant Professor Edgar Solomonik.\nAnd Hutter (BS CompE \u201917) put what he learned to immediate use. He led a project that produced a new communication-avoiding algorithm for obtaining an orthogonal factorization of a matrix. He also\u00a0created a way to employ that algorithm, showing for the first time how additional memory can be used to speed execution time over state-of-the-art libraries for what is a near-universal problem, Solomonik said.\nNow a second-year computer science PhD student, Hutter\u2019s work has earned him a Computational Science Graduate Fellowship from the U.S. Department of Energy. The CSGF is the most prestigious and competitive computational science fellowship available from the federal agency, according to Solomonik, who is Hutter\u2019s advisor.\nHutter was one of the two University of Illinois students to win one this fall, along with biochemistry PhD student Anda Trifan. Fewer than 6 percent of applicants are chosen each year.\nThe fellowships are administered by the Krell Institute in Ames, Iowa. They support PhD students focused on using high-performance computers to solve science and engineering problems that are of national importance. In Hutter\u2019s case, that means using high-performance computing to improve the scalability of existing methods in quantum chemistry.\n\u201cThe Department of Energy recognizes the importance of applying high performance computing to the field of quantum chemistry,\u201d he said. \u201cImproving existing algorithms to reduce communication will lead to computational methods that achieve higher accuracy at less cost.\u201d\nHutter, who is from Geneva, Ill., plans to use his fellowship to develop practical algorithms to minimize communication costs of QR and eigenvalue factorizations conducted over a network. He also plans to investigate tensor factorizations for representing high-accuracy wave functions necessary in many electronic structure calculations.\n\u201cMy research seeks to improve the scalability of electronic structure calculations in both theory and practice through the development of communication-avoiding tensor factorizations,\" Hutter said.\nSolomonik said the fellowship should provide Hutter with a demanding and closely guided experience.\nThe DOE CSG Fellowship \u201cexposes students to a wide network of alumni from a diverse set of disciplines in sciences and computation, who are present at every major national research lab and at most top universities,\u201d Solomonik said.\nHutter, who called being chosen for the fellowship \u201can honor and a privilege,\u201d echoed Solomonik on the uniqueness of the opportunity ahead of him.\n\u201cThis fellowship provides the opportunity to explore electronic structure calculations from a computer science background that would not have been possible otherwise,\u201d including spending part of a summer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee.\n"}, {"source": "University of Illinois", "title": "Kudaligama\u2019s Service to Grad Students, Illinois CS Earns Graduate College Recognition ", "link": "/news/kudaligama-s-service-grad-students-illinois-cs-earns-graduate-college-recognition", "date": "11/29/2018", "content": "\n\u201cAsk Viveka.\u201d\nInterim Department Head Vikram Adve says going to Viveka Kudaligama, the coordinator of graduate programs for Illinois Computer Science, is the default answer to any number of questions related to being a grad student in the department.\nSome of those questions are routine. Some are anything but.\nIn 2015, Kudaligama was asked to figure out how to help when an Illinois CS PhD student was barred from returning to the United States after attending a conference. Helping, as it turned out, required months of navigating complex federal rules, helping the student, Motahhare Eslami, navigate a process that was evolving based on international politics, and just plain being there for Eslami.\nFor those efforts and others, Kudaligama has been honored with the 2018 Graduate College Excellence Award for Graduate Contacts.\n\u201cNot knowing whether or not I would be able to return to campus was a very scary situation, but Viveka\u2019s guidance kept me optimistic and calmer than I would have been without her,\u201d Eslami wrote in a letter supporting Kudaligama\u2019s nomination.\nThe award, Kudaligama said, came as a pleasant surprise.\n\u201cAbsolutely, given the number of people who work with the graduates on campus,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are people who've been in their current positions or been in the system for many, many years and doing great things.\u201d\nBut Kudaligama, according to all of those involved in nominating her, stands out.\nBoth Adve and Professor Chandra Chekuri credit her for putting in long hours and playing a key role in the launch of the successful Master of Computer Science in Data Science program.\nAnd Chekuri says his three years as director of Graduate Studies started with his own concerns about his new position and, at the time, her new role as coordinator.\n\u201cMy concerns were unwarranted,\u201d he said in his own letter backing Kudaligama\u2019s nomination. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have asked for a better person to work with.\u201d\nShe also brings expertise based on her own experience as a grad student. She has a master\u2019s degree in agricultural and resources economics from the University of Hawai\u2019i at Manoa and was a PhD student in agricultural economics at the University of Illinois.\n\u201cI still miss sometimes not being able to be in the classrooms. I really enjoyed the TA appointments I had -- probably too much,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I'm telling students, \u2018You might really, really, really like this, but you have to focus on getting the degree completed.\u2019\u201d\nBut of all the work that the award recognized, Eslami\u2019s predicament is the most dramatic.\nEslami, a student from Iran, was trying to re-enter the United States in March 2015 after attending a conference in Vancouver. Her visa was revoked for reasons that still aren\u2019t clear, and she was forced to spend a month in Canada trying to clear up her status.\nShe had difficulties getting paid for the research assistant work she had already done on campus, and, as she discovered, no immediate way back.\nKudaligama worked with the Graduate College, the International Student and Scholar Services office, and campus legal counsel \u2013 which also worked with an outside immigration lawyer -- trying to resolve the situation. She also found an emergency fund that allowed Eslami to apply for some short-term financial help.\nEslami eventually was forced to return to Iran. while her\u00a0husband, Illinois\u00a0CS PhD student Amirhossein Aleyasen, stayed on campus.\nThere, she could no longer work with her advisor, Professor Karrie Karahalios. The services of\u00a0a professor, they discovered, fall under the embargo against trade with Iran.\n\u201cI know about trade embargoes, I know about the trade sanctions,\u201d Kudaligama said, noting her agricultural background. \u201cBut I always thought of trade sanctions in terms of your wheat and the corn and hogs, soybeans.\u201d\nThe two stayed in regular contact over the months that followed while Eslami worked through the extensive background checks required to regain her visa.\n\u201cDuring that year I was writing to her almost every day, perhaps more than once a day sometimes when things were happening,\u201d Kudaligama said.\nAnd in February of 2016 Eslami did get her visa back, re-enrolling and rejoining her husband.\nShe\u2019s on track to graduate in May.\nThe bond Kudaligama says the two developed is no doubt stronger because of what happened, but not out of the ordinary, she aid.\n\u201cI feel like I've gotten to know her a little bit more,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that is part of being a student here, too.\u201d\n"}, {"source": "University of Illinois", "title": "Gropp Named AAAS Fellow ", "link": "/news/gropp-named-aaas-fellow", "date": "11/27/2018", "content": "\nIllinois Computer Science Professor William D.

These accounts, regardless of origin, share inaccurate and often politically divisive information.\nIllinois Computer Science\u00a0Professor and Willett Faculty Scholar Tarek Abdelzaher is working with his students on a unique way to identify these bots among millions of existing Twitter accounts. Rather than focus on individual account actions, Abdelzaher looks at the larger picture of misinformation campaigns.\n\u201cSometimes if you look at one account by itself it looks normal, but if you look at it compared to others in you realize it\u2019s a bot,\u201d said Abdelzaher, who is also a member of the Coordinated Science Laboratory. \u201cYou realize, geez for some reason the groups of accounts tweet\u00a0exactly the same things at exactly the same time. The odds of humans being so in sync that they tweet the exact same thing at the exact same time is impossible. It\u2019s a race against escalating attacker sophistication, where more complex statistical analysis is used to expose more complex bot group behaviors\u201d\nThe intentions of the bot controllers vary, but they are frequently used to intimidate, motivate, or recruit people, or to change people\u2019s minds via mass messaging. This is what prompted Abdelzaher to look at groupings of identical tweets rather than single accounts to identify bots. The strategy led Abdelzaher\u2019s team to assist with uncovering an ISIS information campaign last year, showing that there are significant military applications to this technology as well as social.\n\u201cThe goal of the research was to identify these types of propaganda sources and isolate them,\u201d Abdelzaher said. \u201cWe wanted to expose them for what they are. Or at least show that the information they are sharing isn\u2019t genuine, it\u2019s coming from a set of bots coming from such and such foreign country.\u201d\nOriginally, the technology behind the bot detection was used for communicating social events. The tool, Apollo \u2013 also created by Abdelzaher, would gather information about an event on social media and provide a summarized and condensed version of what was happening. Of course, not everything on the internet is true, so additional research was necessary to determine the credibility of information.\nThe technology \u2013 which has so far only been used on the Twitter platform \u2013 uses only public information. Any information collected by the tool is already searchable by any twitter user and is collected using Twitter\u2019s public interface in compliance with the company\u2019s user agreements. But the hope is that is can be used across multiple social media platforms.\n\u201cThe main value-added function is that it cleans up the information a bit, sort of like a spam filter for your email or a Brita for your water,\u201d Abdelzaher said. \u201cThat's where all the research is. So, for example, if a disaster occurs and people publicly ask for help by posting on Twitter, Apollo can report that, but it'll be smart enough to detect if something does not seem genuine, in which case it may discard it as misinformation/spam.\u201d\nSocial media platforms and the people who use them for malicious purposes aren\u2019t going away anytime soon. With better detection research and technology, identifying the real users from the bots will make it more difficult for the nonhuman users to spread their message.\nThis project is funded by the Army Research Lab\u2019s Internet of Battlefield Things project.\n\nSee the original CSL story.\n"}, {"source": "University of Illinois", "title": "Cohens Give Back Because of Opportunities Illinois CS Provided, Hope Others Will Follow ", "link": "/news/cohens-give-back-because-opportunities-illinois-cs-provided-hope-others-will-follow", "date": "11/15/2018", "content": "\nOn campus in October for the Illinois Computer Science Celebration of Excellence Student Awards Ceremony, Debra and Ira Cohen had a chance to see their own generosity at work.\nIra Cohen (BS CS \u201980) is an Illinois CS graduate and he and Debra Cohen have long donated \u2013 funding three scholarships and a fellowship -- to help students finance the kind of education that he received, and give them the ability to take full advantage of the department and the university around them.

His research group, the Laboratory for Parallel Numerical Algorithms, leads the development of the CYCLOPS library for tensor computations, which encapsulates optimized communication-avoiding algorithms using a high-level language for tensor algebra. CYCLOPS has enabled groundbreaking simulations of electronic structure and quantum circuits, while also being applied to graph and data analysis.\u201d\nSolomonik was nominated for the TCHPC Award by Professor James Demmel, the chair of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley, and Solomonik\u2019s PhD advisor.\nIn nominating his former student, Demmel noted the motivation of Solomonik\u2019s work, and the advances for which he is responsible.\n\u201cEdgar\u2019s work \u2026 is motivated by avoiding communication, i.e. minimizing data movement, since moving data (between levels of memory or over networks) is more expensive in time and energy than arithmetic,\u201d Demmel wrote, noting that in some cases his work led to operations that improved efficiency by many times and that CYCLOPS is widely used in computational chemistry.\nSolomonik noted that communication avoidance is a common theme in high performance computing.\n\u201cMy research is especially focused on supercomputers and large clusters where you have many, many nodes connected across a large network and they\u2019re sending a little bit of data from one machine to another, which can cost a few orders of magnitudes more than doing some on that machine,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that kind of changes the perspective on how algorithms should be designed and also how software should be designed.\u201d\nSolomonik, as Demmel noted, created the first algorithms for fundamental matrix computations that achieve minimal communication cost.\nThe TCHPC Award is the second in just over a year recognizing Solomonik as a promising young scientist. He won the Householder Prize in 2017.\nThe latest honor, he said, both feels good and adds to the drive and focus that have so far characterized his career.\n\u201cI think adds drive, to try to do more and succeed more,\u201d Solomonik said. \u201cIf people are recognizing what you\u2019re doing is valuable, it makes you want to do more.\u201d\n\u00a0\n"}, {"source": "University of Illinois", "title": "Jacobson Recognized for Research That Transformed Passenger Screening After 2001 Attacks ", "link": "/news/jacobson-recognized-research-transformed-passenger-screening-after-2001-attacks", "date": "11/12/2018", "content": "\nAs Professor Sheldon Jacobson watched the September 2001 terrorist attacks unfold, he was among the many Americans who realized that life was about to change.\nWhat he did not know was that a National Science Foundation-funded research project he began just days before would be part of that change, creating the groundwork for The Transportation Security Administration\u2019s PreCheck system. Precheck uses risk profiles to try to focus air security resources on higher-risk passengers.\nThe work Jacobson and three of his PhD students carried out while he was part of Department of Mechanical & Industrial Engineering has now been recognized with an IMPACT Prize from The Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences. The IMPACT Prize is awarded every two years and recognizes operations research that has had widespread impact.\nThe award highlights work whose effects have played out over a generation, from the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, through PreCheck\u2019s adoption in 2011 to the recognition of the prize itself this month.\n\u201cIt's a real tribute to a number of people. The students did a phenomenal job in implementing this. (And) Ken Fletcher -- without him, we wouldn't be getting the award because someone had to make it into reality and we didn't have the power to do that,\u201d Jacobson said, referring to the now-retired chief risk officer of the TSA who used the research to design PreCheck. \u201cThis is something that really has changed a lot of people's lives.\u201d\nAnd their taxes.\nUsing his own research and the work of other researchers, Jacobson put what he calls a conservative estimate of the amount of money saved by the program at more than $350 million a year in direct costs alone.\nThe key is the roughly 1 million airline-passenger screenings a day that are PreCheck-qualified passengers. They use dedicated lanes available at more than 200 U.S. airports that require fewer TSA staff members than enhanced screening lanes.\n\n\n\nResoundingly Human podcast\n\n\nDuring the The Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences' conference, Professor Sheldon Jacobson also appeared on the organizatioon's \"Resoundingly Human\" podcast. You can listen here.\n\n\n\nFor the first decade after the attacks, the TSA essentially assumed that all passengers carried the same potential security risks and screened them all accordingly. That situation required either an expensive commitment of resources and time or, assuming that the agency would never have enough of either, the probability that some passengers would inevitably be underscreened.\nThe NSF-funded work that Jacobson had just begun when the attacks happened included a cost-benefit analysis of whether all baggage should be screened using essentially the same technology used in CAT scans.\n\u201cWe can't treat everybody like a terrorist. You have to treat people commensurate with their risk and that was the kind of nascent idea of what became risk-based security,\u201d Jacobson said. \u201cHow can we take security resources and passenger risk and bring them together in an optimal way? So we used optimization models to analyze systems.\u201d\nThe three students Jacobson worked with over a period of years and who share in the award were Laura Albert, who is now an associate professor of Industrial and Systems Engineering and assistant dean for Graduate Affairs, at the University of Wisconsin, Madison; Alexander Nikolaev, now an associate professor of Industrial and Systems Engineering at University at Buffalo; and Adrian Lee, who is president of Central Illinois Technology and Education Research Institute.\nAlbert, Jacobson said, was part of what he called the \u201cAh ha! moment\u201d when the use of dynamic rather than static models for passenger screening \u2013 looking at passenger risk over a period of time rather than focusing on any particular moment \u2013 started to make sense.\nLater, Nikolaev came up with the policies that would be best for implanting the system. And Lee, whose background was in control theory, worked to sort out a balance between underscreening and overscreening passengers.\n\u201cHow do you do that? Every person has a risk profile,\u201d Jacobson said.\nThe prize represents a form of validation, not so much for Jacobson or his former students as for the power and reach of a major research university, he said.\n\u201cSo often we're criticized in academia, that we're not doing anything relevant,\u201d he said. \u201cThe prize recognizes the fact that this institution, the University of Illinois, can facilitate things like this, and I'm just one of 2,000 faculty members doing things, working hard, and serving.\u201d\n"}, {"source": "University of Illinois", "title": "Acun\u2019s Focus on HPC Energy Efficiency Leads to Dissertation Recognition from SIGHPC ", "link": "/news/acun-s-focus-hpc-energy-efficiency-leads-dissertation-recognition-sighpc", "date": "11/9/2018", "content": "\nAs an undergraduate, Bilge Acun was drawn to supercomputers and the scientific discovery they made possible. But as she learned more about the tremendous amounts of power they consume, Acun focused on ways to make them more energy efficient, eventually writing her PhD dissertation on the subject.\nAcun\u2019s dissertation has been recognized with an honorable mention in the inaugural Doctoral Dissertation Award competition of the Association for Computing Machinery Special Interest Group on High Performance Computing (SIGHPC).\nAcun (PhD CS \u201917) said the recognition of her dissertation, \u201cMitigating Variability in HPC Systems and Applications for Performance and Power Efficiency,\u201d is a gratifying reflection of the increasing importance of efficiency in high-performance computing.\n\u201cIt is great to see a work on energy efficiency being recognized with this award,\u201d she said. \u201cThe HPC community is traditionally solely focused on performance, but metrics beyond execution time are becoming increasingly important, including energy and power, and the award signifies that importance to me.\u201d\nImproving energy efficiency is important to Acun, she said, because of concerns about climate change and the growing need for energy to power high-performance computers. As noted in her dissertation, a petaflop supercomputer requires millions of dollars\u2019 worth of machine and cooling power each year.\n\u201c(And) the size of the data-centers and supercomputers keeps growing,\u201d she said.\nAcun, who is now a researcher at IBM\u2019s Thomas J. Watson Research Center in New York, began working on processor variability as a PhD student following a suggestion by a fellow student, Phil Miller (PhD \u201916 and now the owner of a computing consultancy firm). Miller and Acun were both part of Professor Laxmikant \u201cSanjay\u201d Kale\u2019s Parallel Programming Laboratory.\nIn her dissertation, Acun analyzed frequency, temperature, power, and application-level variations in large-scale HPC systems, identifying their causes and proposing solutions:\n\nFrequency variations, she found, were a result of differences in the power efficiency of chips because of the manufacturing process. She proposed speed-aware dynamic load balancing strategies to mitigate those variations.\nThe manufacturing process was also the culprit behind power variations, leading Acun to propose variation-aware node-assembly methods.\nAcun pointed to inefficiencies in fan-based cooling systems as the cause of temperature variations, and settled on decoupled fan-control mechanisms with a learning-based temperature prediction model as a solution.\nAnd finally she pinpointed characteristics of the applications themselves (such as different kernel types) as the source of variance at the application level. Her solution was a fine-grained runtime based technique to mitigate those variations.\n\n\u201cEnergy and performance efficiency improvements are historically enabled by hardware improvements, however I see runtime systems as a big opportunity for computer scientists to help,\u201d she said.\nAt IBM Research, Acun is continuing to work on improving the power efficiency as well as the performance of heterogeneous systems.\nFor inspiration she draws on the scientific applications that current large-scale computers and future exascale systems could make possible \u2013 new ways to treat cancer, for instance, and giving doctors a better understanding of the brain and heart through simulations.\nAcun says she finds inspiration in her experience in the Parallel Programming Laboratory, where Kale \u2013 her PhD advisor \u2013 fostered a culture of collaboration and respect.\n\u201cProfessor Kale has a wealth of technical knowledge in parallel computing and HPC area,\u201d she said. \u201cHe allowed me to grow as an independent researcher and work on the topics that I cared about.\"\n"}, {"source": "University of Illinois", "title": "SENSELET Provides Sensory-Driven IoT Network for Scientific Instruments ", "link": "/news/senselet-provides-sensory-driven-iot-network-scientific-instruments", "date": "11/8/2018", "content": "\nWhen fabricating new semiconductors for computer chips, the external environment \u2013 such as the humidity, temperature, or vibration from nearby machines \u2013 can make or break the experiment.

She delivered the keynote address at the previous night\u2019s Women in Computer Science Alumni-Student Dinner.\nSome of the highlights from the panel:\nHOW VIABLE IS CHICAGO AS A PLACE TO BEGIN A TECH CAREER?\nERLEBACHER (who lives and works in the Chicago area): \u201cI think the city\u2019s committed to doing more. Many of the universities \u2013 Illinois, Northwestern, (the University of) Chicago \u2013 come help build Chicago. I\u2019d say it\u2019s definitely on the upswing.\u201d\nGILBERT: \u201cI\u2019m from Chicago, I think Chicago\u2019s great. \u2026 I think for most of my career, I\u2019ve felt the inexorable pull of the Bay Area. And I feel like that\u2019s changing. So in Ann Arbor where I (live), you saw Duo Security get (started), stay there, exit, and continue to stay there. That was unthinkable 10 years ago.\u201d\nMACGREGOR: \u201cI guess my job today is to be the contrarian. \u2026 The bigger question\u2019s not where you\u2019re going to go, but what you\u2019re going to be doing through the first 10 years of your career. Work your butt off. The idea that you can just go in and spend eight hours and \u2018I\u2019m balanced and I\u2019m more productive\u2019 is total baloney.\n\u201cGo wherever that best opportunity is. And then when you get into your mid-30s and you want to have a family, you want more balance, you want to spend time with kids, that\u2019s great. But you\u2019ve got your career foundation built.\u201d\nLASSNER: \u201cYou can do great work anywhere,\u201d citing the example of University of Hawaii Emeritus Professor Norman Abrahamson, who led the development of the ALOHAnet, the first wireless packet network, after beginning his career at Stanford University and the University of California-Berkeley.\n\u201cHe decided he wanted to move to Hawaii because he wanted to surf more, joined the Electrical Engineering Department, and invented the ALOHAnet.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlumni Awards Week\n\n\nIn addition to the panel and dinner and awards ceremony, honorees and students enjoyed a keynote address by Mark Tebbe (BS CS '83). (Watch the video.) He is chairman of ChicagoNEXT at World Business Chicago and an\u00a0adjunct professor of entrepreneurship\u00a0at the University of Chicago Booth\u00a0School of Business.\nAward winners enjoyed a working breakfast at the University of Illinois Research Park and your of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications\u2019 National Petascale Computing Facility.\nAs part of the awards weekend, the annual Women in Computer Science Alumni-Student Dinner was also held, including a keynote address by Rita Patel Jackson (BS Math and CS, \u201988). (Watch the video.) She is the head of global marketing for GE Healthcare\u2019s Healthcare Analytics organization.\n\n\nWHAT IS YOUR BEST METHOD FOR AVOIDING PROCRASTINATION?\nCYTRON: \u201cYou want a healthy balance in life, right? My son, who is now 20 years old, would get up from dinner, go play the piano, go play the ukulele, go play \u2018Fortnite\u2019 for a while. So the problem is you do that indefinitely to the effect of never getting your work done. The goal in life is, what you want to do and have to do become the same thing eventually.\u201d\nERLEBACHER: \u201cUsually the things that I procrastinate on were the things that were too big, they were daunting. So my suggestion is find a way to break it down into bits so you can have that satisfaction of, \u2018Oh, step one of five, I\u2019ve completed step one.\u2019 Just break it down into smaller problems. That\u2019s what we teach in computer science, right?\u201d\nPATEL JACKSON: \u201cSometimes (procrastination is) OK. I know how long physically, mentally it\u2019s going to take me to get things done, and I work well under pressure. And not everybody does. \u2026 So if you work good under pressure and you can get it done, it\u2019s good quality work, have at it.\u201d\n\nWHAT IS THE KEY TO PRODUCTIVE AND HAPPY TEAMWORK?\nGILBERT: \u201cI think it\u2019s a lot of psychology, actually. Go south of Green Street, take a psychology class.\n\u201cYou have to have a shared goal, you have to buy into the goal, you have to have trust with the people who are working that you\u2019re going to have their back \u2013 that if I need help you\u2019ll pitch in and help me, but it\u2019s going to be reciprocal.\u201d\nDHAR: \u201cI had an internship when I was a CS student here. I was pretty young, I think it was my first job ever. So I had an assignment and one day, I worked until around 6:30 or so, and most of the people had left. I decided \u2018OK, I\u2019m going to go home now.\u2019\n\u201cI walked back in the next morning and I had one of those moments that defined the rest of my career, where the person who was supervising me asked me to come in and we sat down. He said \u2018Is this thing done yet?\u2019 I said \u2018No, I\u2019m going to do it today.\u2019 He said, \u2018Listen, you didn\u2019t get your thing done, so nobody else on the team was able to do their work. Now they\u2019re waiting for you.\u2019\n\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t go home before 9 p.m. one more night that summer. But more to the point, what happens on teams is you let people own their work. If you really think about them as the owners, the people who make the team succeed, then you don\u2019t have to manage anybody. You let people manage themselves and everybody comes together and gets something done.\u201d\n"}, {"source": "University of Illinois", "title": "Adve\u2019s Research on Memory Consistency Models, Influence on Hardware and Software Worlds Recognized with Kennedy Award ", "link": "/news/adve-s-research-memory-consistency-models-influence-hardware-and-software-worlds-recognized", "date": "10/31/2018", "content": "\nIllinois Computer Science Professor Sarita Adve has been named the recipient of the 2018 ACM/IEEE-CS Ken Kennedy Award by the Association for Computing Machinery and IEEE Computer Society. The award recognizes her influential work and leadership at the interface of hardware and software.\nAdve is the third Illinois CS professor to win the prestigious award in the past nine years, joining 2010 winner David J. Kuck and 2016 winner William D. Gropp.\nThe 2018 Kennedy Award, which was announced Oct. 31, recognizes Adve \u201cfor research contributions and leadership in the development of memory consistency models for C++ and Java, for service to numerous computer science organizations, and for exceptional mentoring.\u201d\nAdve, who is the Richard T. Cheng Professor of Computer Science, said the research behind the award began in her earliest work, at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where she earned a PhD in 1993.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is an area I started working on as a grad student and continue to work on. That\u2019s quite unusual, but just happened to be a problem that was a really hard problem,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the reasons that it\u2019s hard is that this problem affects both hardware and software. \u2026 It\u2019s at the heart of the notion of correct behavior of a computer, and yet this is a part of that puzzle that has been really hard to solve.\u201d\nAdve co-developed the memory models for C++ and Java (with Hans Boehm, Bill Pugh, and others), based on her early work on data-race-free (DRF) models (with her PhD advisor, Mark Hill).\u00a0 The memory model specifies what value a read of a memory address will return, and is key to the correctness and performance of threaded programs, languages, compilers, and hardware. By impacting the models of the most widely used programming languages, Adve\u2019s work has influenced the worldwide software community and hardware design.\nBut she notes the idea did not take hold overnight.\n\u201cWe wrote the first paper in 1990,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was very well received. But it took a long time for people to really understand our idea that a memory model should be viewed as a contract between hardware and software where software obeys certain rules (data-race-free) and hardware promises sequential consistency. That this idea struck the sweet spot between programmability and performance took over a decade to really take hold.\u201d\nMore recently, with her students, Adve questioned the conventional wisdom for memory models for heterogeneous systems and showed that DRF is a superior model even for such systems.\nOne of the students who played a key role in that research was Matt Sinclair (PhD CS \u201917), now an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin.\n\u201cSarita is an excellent mentor, and I've benefited tremendously from the opportunity to work with her and learn from her,\u201d Sinclair said. \u201cIn particular, Sarita is really good at treating each person uniquely, and identifying the best way to mentor them and bring out their best.\u00a0 This is something I strive to emulate in my post-graduate career.\u201d\nAdve\u2019s broader research interests are at the hardware-software interface and span the system stack from hardware to applications. She is also known for her innovations in cache coherence, hardware reliability, and power management.\nPennsylvania State University Emeritus Professor and Illinois Computer Science graduate Mary Jane Irwin (MS CS \u201975, PhD \u201977) nominated Adve for the award and called her \"a natural and right choice,\" based on her teaching, mentoring, and community service, as well as the impact of her research.\n\"Sarita\u2019s long-term and impactful work on designing and formally specifying memory consistency models has had profound, real-world impact on programmability and productivity in computing,\" Irwin wrote. \"The memory consistency model lies at the heart of the semantics of any threaded software or hardware. Arguably, it has been one of the most challenging and contentious areas in concurrent hardware and software specification for many years.\"\nThe award also recognizes Adve, in part,\u00a0for her extensive service to the computing community.\n\u201cTo be a good researcher is not sufficient in my mind, we need to give back,\u201d she said.\nHer service includes working as the current chair of the ACM Special Interest Group on Computer Architecture (SIGARCH), where she instituted changes that have inspired new energy in the executive committee, leading to new programs in communications, research visioning, and mentoring. With colleagues, she also has made diversity and inclusion a key focus and led the creation of CARES, a committee to provide support to those who experienced harassment at SIGARCH and SIGMICRO sponsored events.\nAdve also serves on the ACM Council and the DARPA ISAT study group and previously served on the board of the Computing Research Association and the NSF CISE advisory committee.\nAdve is a recipient of the Anita Borg Institute Women of Vision award in innovation, the ACM SIGARCH Maurice Wilkes award, and an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship. She is a Fellow of the ACM and IEEE and was named a University Scholar by the University of Illinois.\nThe award will be presented at SC 18: The International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis, in Dallas, Texas on Nov. 13.\nKuck, who is an emeritus professor, won the 2010 Kennedy Award for \u201cpioneering contributions to compiler technology and parallel computing, the profound impact of his research on industry, and the widespread and long-lasting influence of his teaching and mentoring.\u201d Gropp, who is both the director of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications and the Thomas M. Siebel Chair in Computer Science, was recognized with the 2016 award for \u201chighly influential contributions to the programmability of high-performance parallel and distributed computers, and extraordinary service to the profession.\u201d\nACM and IEEE-CS co-sponsor the Kennedy Award, which was established in 2009 to recognize substantial contributions to programmability and productivity in computing and significant community service or mentoring contributions. It was named for the late Ken Kennedy, founder of Rice University\u2019s computer science program.\n"}, {"source": "University of Illinois", "title": "ThinkChicago Brings City\u2019s Tech Message and Leaders to Illinois CS Students ", "link": "/news/thinkchicago-brings-city-s-tech-message-and-leaders-illinois-cs-students", "date": "10/31/2018", "content": "\nFrom his office in downtown Chicago, Steve Benni leads a team of technologists for JP Morgan Chase & Co.

We can beat them on all these metrics.\u201d\nBenni (BS CS \u201800) was part of a panel of tech executives and entrepreneurs who talked to students during the Roadshow stop at Illinois Computer Science.\nThe Roadshow holds events at college campuses around the state and beyond, working to spread the message of ThinkChicago \u2013 the public-private partnership that works to develop the city\u2019s technology sector -- and encouraging students to explore the professional possibilities the city holds.\nThe Roadshow stop at Illinois CS offered students the chance to connect with representatives of a number of top Chicago-area companies and the opportunity to listen to a panel of tech leaders talk about the city and the resources it offers.\nIn Benni\u2019s case, he told students that Chicago gives him both the career he wants with JP Morgan and the ability to live nearby with his family.\n\u201cI live about a mile and a half from our office in downtown Chicago, and I\u2019m very much a Chicagoan at heart,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve raised my kids in the city.\u201d\nLike Benni, Chicago is both home and a professional advantage for Joe Jablonski.\nJablonski (BS EE \u201893) is the co-founder and CTO of Ocient, a data analytics startup, and a veteran of other area tech startups.\n\u201cWe hire a ton of young engineers, and they all walk or bike to work,\u201d he told students. \u201cThat is an amazing lifestyle.\u201d\nBut Chicago provides advantages to the company beyond a nice way of life for employees, Jablonski said.\nThe past successes of Jablonski and his co-founders \u2013 including the $1.3 billion sale of Cleversafe, which two of them were part of -- meant they could have started Ocient anywhere, but chose Chicago, he said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s one overwhelming reason, and that\u2019s because of the talent that\u2019s in Chicago,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s worth working there and living there for that reason.\u201d\nAnd Ocient is making the most of the region\u2019s talent. About 75 percent of the 21 employees and interns it hired last summer came from the University of Illinois.\nChicago also has a strong track record of founders who have chosen to remain in the city, and a pool of financing that makes more possible, Jablonski said.\n\u201cIn 2004, me and some buddies started a poker game,\u201d he said. \u201cThat group (included) the founders of Grubhub, the founders of Groupon, the founders of Cleversafe, and myself,\u201d he said. \u201cAt Ocient we probably had 50 venture capitalists begging us to put money into Ocient. It really isn\u2019t a problem.\u201d\nMuch of the discussion also focused on hiring. Most of the members of the panel emphasized that they\u2019re looking for people who are skilled technologists and data scientists, but also have broader aspirations.\n\u201cAre you a good cultural fit? Are you passionate? I don\u2019t want somebody who chose engineering just because they wanted to make a lot of money,\u201d said Miranda Kemp, who is director of AARP\u2019s technology labs at the University of Illinois Research Park. She is also a University of Illinois MBA student.\nLong Hei, who is director of Data Science for CCC Information Services in Chicago, said data science comes first when he hires, but \u201cI\u2019m looking for people who want to put on other hats, not just data science hats, but think about the users -- what do they want?\u201d\n\u201cA good data scientist should be trilingual,\u201d he added, able to dive into math, technology, and business.\nBeth Ladd, who is analytics R&D manager and director of the Caterpillar Data Innovation Lab and CAT Digital Lab at the Research Park, looks for students with a similarly varied skill set.\n\u201cWe want folks who are curious, love technology, who are interested in human-centered design,\u201d she said.\nBut at Benni\u2019s group, he said, a love of technology is key.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m looking for is somebody who really wants a career in technology, 10 years from now is still going to be doing something technical.\u201d\n"}, {"source": "University of Illinois", "title": "New Center to Accelerate Quantum Information Science and Engineering ", "link": "/news/new-center-accelerate-quantum-information-science-and-engineering", "date": "10/29/2018", "content": "\nThe University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is making a $15 million investment in the emerging area of quantum information science and engineering, a field poised to revolutionize computing, communication, security, measurement and sensing by utilizing the unique and powerful capabilities of quantum mechanics.\nThe centerpiece of the campus effort will be the formation of the Illinois Quantum Information Science and Technology Center.\u00a0 This will include a major hiring initiative to expand the number of quantum science experts at Illinois across multiple departments throughout the\u00a0College of Engineering\u00a0and the campus. \u00a0The center will also enable the development of a focused program to educate the next-generation quantum workforce.\u00a0 The investment will also include state-of-the-art equipment for the fabrication of quantum materials and devices.\u00a0\nThe center will bring together Illinois\u2019 physicists, engineers, computer scientists and many others to develop new paradigms in quantum information science and technology.

But three Illinois Computer Science professors believe improvements could be found in the inefficiencies of computing systems, and the National Science Foundation believes their idea holds some promise.\nThe NSF has awarded a $1.2 million, four-year grant to Professors Josep Torrellas, Laxmikant V. Kale, and David Padua to work on ways to make existing systems consistently more efficient, which they believe could exponentially improve performance of large servers and data centers. Torrellas is the principal investigator for the project, for which the three will collaborate with chip-maker Advanced Micro Devices.\nThe bottom line, Torrellas said, is CMOS-based computers use energy very inefficiently, for a variety of reasons.\nData has to be gathered from the memory, other chips, or the disk, requiring far more energy than would be used if all operations were performed locally on the processor, he said.\nSecond, many operations use an approach called speculation that consumes a lot of energy and, in many instances, are just plain useless, according to Torrellas.\n\u201cLet\u2019s say a program executes, and hits a branch. The program\u00a0needs to check a condition to decide which way to go. But processors do not wait to figure out the outcome of the condition before moving on because it\u2019s going to take some time,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead the processor follows one path. Then, if that\u2019s wrong, the hardware scraps everything, and goes the other way.\u201d\nAnd finally, using his own office laptop as a small-scale example as it idled nearby, \u201cThis guy is consuming a lot of energy not doing anything,\u201d Torrellas said.\n\u201cSo the combination of these three things make a computer orders of magnitude less efficient than it should be.\u201d\nTorrellas is the Saburo Muroga Professor of Computer Science and his research focuses on architecture, compilers, and parallel computing.\nHe and his collaborators are taking a four-pronged approach to the project:\n\nAdapting control theory \u2013 which is used across engineering to analyze systems and create feedback loops used to control those systems -- to computer architecture.\nDeveloping hardware controllers.\nExtending runtime systems to actuate on the hardware.\nUsing compilers to generate code that is optimal for a highly-controlled cluster or datacenter.\n\nControl theory, Torrellas explained, presents an early unknown in the project. It is often used in aeronautical engineering and mechanical engineering.\n\u201cHow can it be applied to computers? It is an open question,\u201d he said. \u201cComputers are very complicated; building a model of a computer is very hard.\u201d\nThe key, he said, will be to take what he calls an integrated, cross-layer approach to the work.\n\u201cThere\u2019s hardware, the operating system, the compiler, the application,\u201d Torrellas said. \u201cAll these layers, if you optimize them together, you get a higher impact.\u201d\nTorrellas will focus on the hardware.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a large machine built out of nodes, each node will have multiple chips, each chip will have multiple cores,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to build in a hierarchical manner. You control the core, then you control the chip that has multiple cores. Then you have a node that controls multiple chips, and so on.\u201d\nKale, meanwhile, will work on the runtime system. Kale is the Paul and Cynthia Saylor Professor of Computer Science and leads the Parallel Programming Laboratory. His past work includes pioneering research to develop adaptive runtime systems in parallel computing.\n\u201cPower, energy, and temperature are becoming very important issues in extreme-scale computing, even as they are important on cellphones and laptops,\u201d Kale said. \u201cIt is an exciting prospect to combine our work on adaptive runtime systems with controllable adaptive hardware at the lower level and compiler support at higher level, via a common framework provided by a control system.\u201d\nPadua is a Donald Biggar Willett Professor in Engineering and his research focus includes optimization strategies. He will focus on designing compilers.\nThe three professors also plan to compare the use of control theory to improve system efficiency with the use of machine learning.\n\u201cSome people are trying to make the systems more efficient by using machine learning -- an algorithm that\u2019s telling me \u2018shut this hardware down now\u2019 or \u2018move this program here, change the frequency,\u2019 as opposed to control theory, which is based on a more reactive approach,\u201d Torrellas said.\nTorrellas, Kale and Padua also believe the project could serve as a catalyst for interdisciplinary research and education on clusters and data-center technology at Illinois.\n"}, {"source": "University of Illinois", "title": "Siebel Chair Gift Keeps Giving To Gropp And Illinois CS Researchers ", "link": "/news/siebel-chair-gift-keeps-giving-gropp-and-illinois-cs-researchers", "date": "10/12/2018", "content": "\nAs a young researcher, Bill Gropp worked in a world where scientists with bright ideas could find the funding to explore them before they had any results in hand.\nThat world has radically changed, Gropp says, requiring researchers to have at least some promising findings before they can secure the money to see their ideas through.\nBut as the Thomas M. Siebel Chair in Computer Science, Professor Gropp has a tool that lets him sometimes turn back the clock.\nThe chair gives Gropp money he can use at his discretion to launch the kind of \u201ccuriosity-driven research\u201d that he says often leads to truly transformative ideas.\n\u201cIt\u2019s seed money \u2013 incredibly valuable seed money,\u201d said Gropp, who is also director of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. \u201cThis is what\u2019s really valuable with the resources that come with the chair. It gives you this opportunity to explore without having to wedge it into your grant funding or finding some other way to do it on a shoestring.\u201d\nThe Siebel Chair in Computer Science was established in 2013 with a $2 million gift from the Thomas and Stacey Siebel Foundation, the charitable organization established by Illinois Computer Science alumnus Thomas Siebel (BA History \u201975, MBA \u201983, MS CS \u201985).\nSiebel, who is the chairman and CEO of enterprise software company C3 IoT and before that founded Siebel Systems, is an active philanthropist. The foundation supports efforts related to everything from energy solutions and public health to caring for the homeless.\nThe Siebel Chair reflects two of Siebel\u2019s other philanthropic passions: research and education.\nDiscussing his long history of major gifts to the University of Illinois, Siebel told The News-Gazette in 2014 that the guiding philosophy for philanthropy is \"Make change happen.\"\nGropp became the first Siebel Chair after coming to the university from Argonne National Laboratory in 2007. He had a track record of pioneering the kind of change Siebel talked about. Gropp and collaborators designed the Message Passing Interface, or MPI, the standard that is essential to the parallel processing now at the heart of supercomputing.\nGropp came to Illinois Computer Science as the Paul and Cynthia Saylor Professor in Computer Science, a position that provided him with resources and possibilities beyond the typical faculty position.\nThe Siebel Chair gives Gropp even more, including links to Siebel\u2019s other on-campus endeavors \u2013 the Siebel Scholars and the new Siebel Center for Design.\n\u201cPart of having that chair is interacting with these other things,\u201d Gropp said. \u201cI\u2019ve had some really good discussions with Rachel Switzky, the new head of the Siebel Design Center.\u201d\nAnd, in the bottom-line research world Gropp talked about, the chair provided greater financial resources.\n\u201cI do have more flexibility in saying I can absolutely afford a student on this for a couple of years. \u2026 I just don\u2019t have to worry about it,\u201d Gropp said.\nErin Molloy is one of several students now working on projects started at least in part with money from the Siebel Chair. Molloy is a CS PhD student being advised by both Gropp and Founder Professor of Engineering Tandy Warnow, whose primary research area is bioinformatics and computational biology.\nMolloy is working to scale species tree estimation to build out the tree of life, a problem that involves a lot of data, highly parallel computing, and algorithms that produce very precise results.\n\u201cThe work that Erin is doing I think is going to be really transformative,\u201d Gropp said. \u201cShe was sort of marrying the algorithmic work that Tandy does with the high-performance computing work that I do to create new methods for going after very big and very difficult problems.\u201d\nProjects like Molloy\u2019s, he said, remind him of work that happens at companies like Google and 3M that give employees time and other resources to \u2013 as Gropp likes to say \u2013 just explore. Using the 3M example, he points out that Post-it Notes grew out of such freedom.\n\u201cWe\u2019re lucky enough to have this flexibility, we can still do the curiosity-driven work that often is going to generate the most important ideas, I think,\u201d Gropp said. \u201cPeople who don\u2019t have to run in the rat race of bringing in the funding don\u2019t understand how much time we now spend chasing funding as opposed to working on developing new ideas.\u201d\n\u00a0\n"}, {"source": "University of Illinois", "title": "Professor Jiawei Han Joins Select Group With Funai Achievement Award ", "link": "/news/professor-jiawei-han-joins-select-group-funai-achievement-award", "date": "10/12/2018", "content": "\nThe Funai Achievement Award is Japan\u2019s highest honor for information science, and before 2018 only three non-Japanese researchers had ever won it.\nIllinois Computer Science Professor Jiawei Han last month became the fourth, when he was announced as the 2018 winner.\nThe Information Processing Society of Japan awarded Han \u201cfor his pioneering work on Data Mining, Information Network Analysis, Database Systems, and Data Warehousing.\u201d\nHan, who is an Abel Bliss Professor in Engineering, described in understated fashion one of the primary reasons he was honored.\nIn the 1990s, \u201cA lot of people in the U.S. and Japan were thinking about getting into data mining, and I was kind of an early bird.\u201d\nIllinois Computer Science Interim Department Head Vikram Adve noted that, Han\u2019s modesty aside, the award was both a remarkable honor and well deserved.\n\u201cThis is a highly prestigious award, and extraordinarily few outside Japan have received it,\u201d Adve said. \u201cProfessor Han is the perfect choice for this award, because of his outstanding technical contributions in the field of data mining, his long-standing leadership of the community, and his mentoring of numerous leaders in the younger generation of data mining academics and researchers.\u201d\nThe only other non-Japanese winners of the Funai Achievement Award are ACM Turing Award winners Alan Kay (2002) and Marvin Minsky (2003), as well as William J.

As the changes are integrated, regression tests are run to find out whether changes introduce bugs into the code.\n\u201cDevelopers do these actions typically several times per day. It can take anywhere from five, 10 minutes to literally hours (for each),\u201d Marinov said. \u201cIf this thing is going to take two hours to give them the result back, they\u2019re just going to idle -- they\u2019re going to start reading emails, go on the web.
