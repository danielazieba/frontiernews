Gropp has been named a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).\nAs part of the Information, Computing and Communication section, Gropp, who is Director and Chief Scientist of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) and the Thomas M. Siebel Chair in the Department of Computer Science at Illinois, was elected as an AAAS Fellow for his distinguished contributions to scalable algorithms and software for high performance computing.\nElection as an AAAS Fellow is an honor bestowed upon AAAS members by their peers. This year, 416 members have been awarded this honor by AAAS because of their scientifically or socially distinguished efforts to advance science or its applications. New Fellows will be presented with an official certificate and a gold and blue (representing science and engineering, respectively) rosette pin at the AAAS Fellows Forum during the 2019 AAAS Annual Meeting in Washington, D.C. this February and will be\u00a0announced in the \"AAAS News & Notes\" section of the journal Science on November 29, 2018.\n\nThroughout his nearly 40-year career, Gropp has explored parallel computing, software for scientific computing, numerical methods for partial differential equations, and the development of efficient and scalable parallel algorithms for the solution of linear and nonlinear equations. He has played a major role in the development of the MPI message-passing standard and was one of the designers of the PETSc parallel numerical library. Gropp is also recognized as a fellow of the ACM, IEEE, SIAM, and an elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering.\n\u201cThe AAAS is the premier society representing all of science, and it is a leader in communicating science to the public. I\u2019m proud to be a member and I am honored by this recognition,\u201d said Gropp.\nOther 2018 Fellows from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign include Dr. Narayana Aluru of the Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering in the Engineering section, for outstanding contributions to computational, physical, and engineering aspects of nanofluidics and micro/nanoelectromechanical systems including the development of novel multiphysics and multiscale methods; Dr. Andrew D.B. Leakey of the Department of Crop Sciences in the Agriculture, Food and Renewable Resources section, for distinguished contributions to plant science, particularly for advancing integrative understanding of crop carbon and water relations in the context of global environmental change; and Dr. Ray Ming of the School of Integrative Biology, also in the Agriculture, Food and Renewable Resources section, for distinguished contribution to the field of sex chromosome evolution, particularly using genomic technologies to study early stages of sex chromosomes relevant to crop improvement.\nThe tradition of AAAS Fellows began in 1874. Currently, members can be considered for the rank of Fellow if nominated by the steering groups of the Association\u2019s 24 sections, or by any three Fellows who are current AAAS members (so long as two of the three sponsors are not affiliated with the nominee\u2019s institution), or by the AAAS chief executive officer. Fellows must have been continuous members of AAAS for four years by the end of the calendar year in which they are elected. AAAS Fellow\u2019s lifetime honor comes with an expectation that recipients maintain the highest standards of professional ethics and scientific integrity.\n\nEach steering group reviews the nominations of individuals within its respective section and a final list is forwarded to the AAAS Council, which votes on the aggregate list.\u00a0The Council is the policymaking body of the Association, chaired by the AAAS president, and consisting of the members of the board of directors, the retiring section chairs, delegates from each electorate and each regional division, and two delegates from the National Association of Academies of Science.\n\u00a0\n\n\nABOUT AAAS\nThe American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) is the world\u2019s largest general scientific society and publisher of the journal Science (www.sciencemag.org) as well as Science Translational Medicine, Science Signaling, a digital, open-access journal, Science Advances, Science Immunology, and Science Robotics.

These accounts, regardless of origin, share inaccurate and often politically divisive information.\nIllinois Computer Science\u00a0Professor and Willett Faculty Scholar Tarek Abdelzaher is working with his students on a unique way to identify these bots among millions of existing Twitter accounts. Rather than focus on individual account actions, Abdelzaher looks at the larger picture of misinformation campaigns.\n\u201cSometimes if you look at one account by itself it looks normal, but if you look at it compared to others in you realize it\u2019s a bot,\u201d said Abdelzaher, who is also a member of the Coordinated Science Laboratory. \u201cYou realize, geez for some reason the groups of accounts tweet\u00a0exactly the same things at exactly the same time. The odds of humans being so in sync that they tweet the exact same thing at the exact same time is impossible. It\u2019s a race against escalating attacker sophistication, where more complex statistical analysis is used to expose more complex bot group behaviors\u201d\nThe intentions of the bot controllers vary, but they are frequently used to intimidate, motivate, or recruit people, or to change people\u2019s minds via mass messaging. This is what prompted Abdelzaher to look at groupings of identical tweets rather than single accounts to identify bots. The strategy led Abdelzaher\u2019s team to assist with uncovering an ISIS information campaign last year, showing that there are significant military applications to this technology as well as social.\n\u201cThe goal of the research was to identify these types of propaganda sources and isolate them,\u201d Abdelzaher said. \u201cWe wanted to expose them for what they are. Or at least show that the information they are sharing isn\u2019t genuine, it\u2019s coming from a set of bots coming from such and such foreign country.\u201d\nOriginally, the technology behind the bot detection was used for communicating social events. The tool, Apollo \u2013 also created by Abdelzaher, would gather information about an event on social media and provide a summarized and condensed version of what was happening. Of course, not everything on the internet is true, so additional research was necessary to determine the credibility of information.\nThe technology \u2013 which has so far only been used on the Twitter platform \u2013 uses only public information. Any information collected by the tool is already searchable by any twitter user and is collected using Twitter\u2019s public interface in compliance with the company\u2019s user agreements. But the hope is that is can be used across multiple social media platforms.\n\u201cThe main value-added function is that it cleans up the information a bit, sort of like a spam filter for your email or a Brita for your water,\u201d Abdelzaher said. \u201cThat's where all the research is. So, for example, if a disaster occurs and people publicly ask for help by posting on Twitter, Apollo can report that, but it'll be smart enough to detect if something does not seem genuine, in which case it may discard it as misinformation/spam.\u201d\nSocial media platforms and the people who use them for malicious purposes aren\u2019t going away anytime soon. With better detection research and technology, identifying the real users from the bots will make it more difficult for the nonhuman users to spread their message.\nThis project is funded by the Army Research Lab\u2019s Internet of Battlefield Things project.\n\nSee the original CSL story.\n"}, {"source": "University of Illinois", "title": "Cohens Give Back Because of Opportunities Illinois CS Provided, Hope Others Will Follow ", "link": "/news/cohens-give-back-because-opportunities-illinois-cs-provided-hope-others-will-follow", "date": "November 15, 2018", "content": "\nOn campus in October for the Illinois Computer Science Celebration of Excellence Student Awards Ceremony, Debra and Ira Cohen had a chance to see their own generosity at work.\nIra Cohen (BS CS \u201980) is an Illinois CS graduate and he and Debra Cohen have long donated \u2013 funding three scholarships and a fellowship -- to help students finance the kind of education that he received, and give them the ability to take full advantage of the department and the university around them. The couple regularly enjoy the chance to meet with the students they help, and see how that help can transform those students and their trajectories.\n\u201cThese kids become mentors to other students,\u201d Ira Cohen said. \u201cThat\u2019s really what our goal is: not just set somebody up for life but to allow them to not work 40 hours while they\u2019re going to school.\u201d\nThe Cohens said they see themselves as part of a living and, they hope, growing cycle \u2013 people who gain from and then give back to the university and the Department of Computer Science.\n\u201cOur hope going forward is that those people who have received the awards will hopefully will look back at their time at the university and say, \u2018Hey, I was given an opportunity, let me do the same thing.\u2019 Pay it forward,\u201d Debra Cohen said.\nThe Cohens have been doing just that for years.\nIn 2005 they established the Ira & Debra Cohen Graduate Fellowship in Computer Science, primarily supporting graduate research in bioinformatics.\nThree years later, the Sara and Louis Cohen Undergraduate Scholarship was first awarded. It was established to honor Ira Cohen\u2019s grandparents.\nAnd the next year, 2009, the Cohens added the William and Ruth Witt Scholarship in honor of Debra Cohen\u2019s parents.\nThe Cohens also served on the Advisory Board when the Engineering Visionary Scholarship Initiative was launched.\nIn 2011, Ira Cohen was recognized among the department\u2019s Alumni Award winners, taking home the Distinguished Service Award.\n\u201cIf we can provide impact, that\u2019s the best thing,\u201d Debra Cohen said.\nThe Cohens are also regulars on campus, holding season tickets for both football and basketball and supporting the golf program.\nTheir ties to the university run deep, and started, for Ira, almost the moment he graduated from high school in Wilmette in the Chicago suburbs.\n\u201cAbout 37 of my high school class wound up going to Illinois,\u201d he said, as well as a sister and cousin who were already on campus when he enrolled.\nOnce at Illinois Computer Science, Cohen found himself immersed in CS in ways he couldn\u2019t have imagined, including exposure to legendary faculty like numerical analysis pioneer Bill Gear.\nBefore that, \u201cI had a programmable calculator -- that was my computer experience,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cMy first class was taught by Bill Gear. I still have the textbook.\u201d\nEventually Cohen went on to cofound Advanced Systems Concepts, in Schaumburg, Illinois, and to meet Debra.\nShe graduated from Robert Morris University, but says she, too, found a home at Illinois.\n\u201cI have a lot of orange and blue in my wardrobe,\u201d she said. \u201cI think a lot of it is that everybody has welcomed me.\u201d\nFor Ira Cohen, a driving factor remains the challenging, dynamic environment he found around him as an Illinois CS student.\n\u201cMOSAIC, I got exposed to email for the first time,\u201d he said, remembering the revolution that was happening around him at the time. \u201cIt was kind of nice be networked into that and be exposed to the innovation that was going on.\u201d\n\u201cThis revolution has happened in the last 30-plus years,\u201d he added, \u201cand a lot of it came out of Illinois.\u201d\n\u00a0\n"}, {"source": "University of Illinois", "title": "Solomonik Recognized for Early Career Work Aimed at Improving HPC Performance ", "link": "/news/solomonik-recognized-early-career-work-aimed-improving-hpc-performance", "date": "November 14, 2018", "content": "\nAs a high school student, Edgar Solomonik was already focused on a career in computer science, working as an intern at a downtown Chicago trading firm.\nCommuting by train back and forth between home in the Chicago suburbs and the office in the Loop, he learned about the sort of dedication and thinking it takes to work and succeed.\n\u201cI already had a mindset for how to debug codes and kind of solve problems by myself, and how to work independently, the kind of work ethic that is associated with that,\u201d said Solomonik, now an assistant professor at Illinois Computer Science and a graduate of the department (BS CS \u201910).\nSolomonik\u2019s focus also has guided his research, which last month was recognized with the IEEE Computer Society\u2019s TCHPC Award for Excellence for Early Career Researchers in High Performance Computing.\nThe award recognizes the 28-year-old Solomonik for research that \u201chas developed more scalable numerical algorithms and high-performance computing libraries. His research group, the Laboratory for Parallel Numerical Algorithms, leads the development of the CYCLOPS library for tensor computations, which encapsulates optimized communication-avoiding algorithms using a high-level language for tensor algebra. CYCLOPS has enabled groundbreaking simulations of electronic structure and quantum circuits, while also being applied to graph and data analysis.\u201d\nSolomonik was nominated for the TCHPC Award by Professor James Demmel, the chair of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley, and Solomonik\u2019s PhD advisor.\nIn nominating his former student, Demmel noted the motivation of Solomonik\u2019s work, and the advances for which he is responsible.\n\u201cEdgar\u2019s work \u2026 is motivated by avoiding communication, i.e. minimizing data movement, since moving data (between levels of memory or over networks) is more expensive in time and energy than arithmetic,\u201d Demmel wrote, noting that in some cases his work led to operations that improved efficiency by many times and that CYCLOPS is widely used in computational chemistry.\nSolomonik noted that communication avoidance is a common theme in high performance computing.\n\u201cMy research is especially focused on supercomputers and large clusters where you have many, many nodes connected across a large network and they\u2019re sending a little bit of data from one machine to another, which can cost a few orders of magnitudes more than doing some on that machine,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that kind of changes the perspective on how algorithms should be designed and also how software should be designed.\u201d\nSolomonik, as Demmel noted, created the first algorithms for fundamental matrix computations that achieve minimal communication cost.\nThe TCHPC Award is the second in just over a year recognizing Solomonik as a promising young scientist. He won the Householder Prize in 2017.\nThe latest honor, he said, both feels good and adds to the drive and focus that have so far characterized his career.\n\u201cI think adds drive, to try to do more and succeed more,\u201d Solomonik said. \u201cIf people are recognizing what you\u2019re doing is valuable, it makes you want to do more.\u201d\n\u00a0\n"}, {"source": "University of Illinois", "title": "Jacobson Recognized for Research That Transformed Passenger Screening After 2001 Attacks ", "link": "/news/jacobson-recognized-research-transformed-passenger-screening-after-2001-attacks", "date": "November 12, 2018", "content": "\nAs Professor Sheldon Jacobson watched the September 2001 terrorist attacks unfold, he was among the many Americans who realized that life was about to change.\nWhat he did not know was that a National Science Foundation-funded research project he began just days before would be part of that change, creating the groundwork for The Transportation Security Administration\u2019s PreCheck system. Precheck uses risk profiles to try to focus air security resources on higher-risk passengers.\nThe work Jacobson and three of his PhD students carried out while he was part of Department of Mechanical & Industrial Engineering has now been recognized with an IMPACT Prize from The Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences. The IMPACT Prize is awarded every two years and recognizes operations research that has had widespread impact.\nThe award highlights work whose effects have played out over a generation, from the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, through PreCheck\u2019s adoption in 2011 to the recognition of the prize itself this month.\n\u201cIt's a real tribute to a number of people. The students did a phenomenal job in implementing this. (And) Ken Fletcher -- without him, we wouldn't be getting the award because someone had to make it into reality and we didn't have the power to do that,\u201d Jacobson said, referring to the now-retired chief risk officer of the TSA who used the research to design PreCheck. \u201cThis is something that really has changed a lot of people's lives.\u201d\nAnd their taxes.\nUsing his own research and the work of other researchers, Jacobson put what he calls a conservative estimate of the amount of money saved by the program at more than $350 million a year in direct costs alone.\nThe key is the roughly 1 million airline-passenger screenings a day that are PreCheck-qualified passengers. They use dedicated lanes available at more than 200 U.S. airports that require fewer TSA staff members than enhanced screening lanes.\n\n\n\nResoundingly Human podcast\n\n\nDuring the The Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences' conference, Professor Sheldon Jacobson also appeared on the organizatioon's \"Resoundingly Human\" podcast. You can listen here.\n\n\n\nFor the first decade after the attacks, the TSA essentially assumed that all passengers carried the same potential security risks and screened them all accordingly. That situation required either an expensive commitment of resources and time or, assuming that the agency would never have enough of either, the probability that some passengers would inevitably be underscreened.\nThe NSF-funded work that Jacobson had just begun when the attacks happened included a cost-benefit analysis of whether all baggage should be screened using essentially the same technology used in CAT scans.\n\u201cWe can't treat everybody like a terrorist. You have to treat people commensurate with their risk and that was the kind of nascent idea of what became risk-based security,\u201d Jacobson said. \u201cHow can we take security resources and passenger risk and bring them together in an optimal way? So we used optimization models to analyze systems.\u201d\nThe three students Jacobson worked with over a period of years and who share in the award were Laura Albert, who is now an associate professor of Industrial and Systems Engineering and assistant dean for Graduate Affairs, at the University of Wisconsin, Madison; Alexander Nikolaev, now an associate professor of Industrial and Systems Engineering at University at Buffalo; and Adrian Lee, who is president of Central Illinois Technology and Education Research Institute.\nAlbert, Jacobson said, was part of what he called the \u201cAh ha! moment\u201d when the use of dynamic rather than static models for passenger screening \u2013 looking at passenger risk over a period of time rather than focusing on any particular moment \u2013 started to make sense.\nLater, Nikolaev came up with the policies that would be best for implanting the system. And Lee, whose background was in control theory, worked to sort out a balance between underscreening and overscreening passengers.\n\u201cHow do you do that? Every person has a risk profile,\u201d Jacobson said.\nThe prize represents a form of validation, not so much for Jacobson or his former students as for the power and reach of a major research university, he said.\n\u201cSo often we're criticized in academia, that we're not doing anything relevant,\u201d he said. \u201cThe prize recognizes the fact that this institution, the University of Illinois, can facilitate things like this, and I'm just one of 2,000 faculty members doing things, working hard, and serving.\u201d\n"}, {"source": "University of Illinois", "title": "Acun\u2019s Focus on HPC Energy Efficiency Leads to Dissertation Recognition from SIGHPC ", "link": "/news/acun-s-focus-hpc-energy-efficiency-leads-dissertation-recognition-sighpc", "date": "November 9, 2018", "content": "\nAs an undergraduate, Bilge Acun was drawn to supercomputers and the scientific discovery they made possible. But as she learned more about the tremendous amounts of power they consume, Acun focused on ways to make them more energy efficient, eventually writing her PhD dissertation on the subject.\nAcun\u2019s dissertation has been recognized with an honorable mention in the inaugural Doctoral Dissertation Award competition of the Association for Computing Machinery Special Interest Group on High Performance Computing (SIGHPC).\nAcun (PhD CS \u201917) said the recognition of her dissertation, \u201cMitigating Variability in HPC Systems and Applications for Performance and Power Efficiency,\u201d is a gratifying reflection of the increasing importance of efficiency in high-performance computing.\n\u201cIt is great to see a work on energy efficiency being recognized with this award,\u201d she said. \u201cThe HPC community is traditionally solely focused on performance, but metrics beyond execution time are becoming increasingly important, including energy and power, and the award signifies that importance to me.\u201d\nImproving energy efficiency is important to Acun, she said, because of concerns about climate change and the growing need for energy to power high-performance computers. As noted in her dissertation, a petaflop supercomputer requires millions of dollars\u2019 worth of machine and cooling power each year.\n\u201c(And) the size of the data-centers and supercomputers keeps growing,\u201d she said.\nAcun, who is now a researcher at IBM\u2019s Thomas J. Watson Research Center in New York, began working on processor variability as a PhD student following a suggestion by a fellow student, Phil Miller (PhD \u201916 and now the owner of a computing consultancy firm). Miller and Acun were both part of Professor Laxmikant \u201cSanjay\u201d Kale\u2019s Parallel Programming Laboratory.\nIn her dissertation, Acun analyzed frequency, temperature, power, and application-level variations in large-scale HPC systems, identifying their causes and proposing solutions:\n\nFrequency variations, she found, were a result of differences in the power efficiency of chips because of the manufacturing process. She proposed speed-aware dynamic load balancing strategies to mitigate those variations.\nThe manufacturing process was also the culprit behind power variations, leading Acun to propose variation-aware node-assembly methods.\nAcun pointed to inefficiencies in fan-based cooling systems as the cause of temperature variations, and settled on decoupled fan-control mechanisms with a learning-based temperature prediction model as a solution.\nAnd finally she pinpointed characteristics of the applications themselves (such as different kernel types) as the source of variance at the application level. Her solution was a fine-grained runtime based technique to mitigate those variations.\n\n\u201cEnergy and performance efficiency improvements are historically enabled by hardware improvements, however I see runtime systems as a big opportunity for computer scientists to help,\u201d she said.\nAt IBM Research, Acun is continuing to work on improving the power efficiency as well as the performance of heterogeneous systems.\nFor inspiration she draws on the scientific applications that current large-scale computers and future exascale systems could make possible \u2013 new ways to treat cancer, for instance, and giving doctors a better understanding of the brain and heart through simulations.\nAcun says she finds inspiration in her experience in the Parallel Programming Laboratory, where Kale \u2013 her PhD advisor \u2013 fostered a culture of collaboration and respect.\n\u201cProfessor Kale has a wealth of technical knowledge in parallel computing and HPC area,\u201d she said. \u201cHe allowed me to grow as an independent researcher and work on the topics that I cared about.\"\n"}, {"source": "University of Illinois", "title": "SENSELET Provides Sensory-Driven IoT Network for Scientific Instruments ", "link": "/news/senselet-provides-sensory-driven-iot-network-scientific-instruments", "date": "November 8, 2018", "content": "\nWhen fabricating new semiconductors for computer chips, the external environment \u2013 such as the humidity, temperature, or vibration from nearby machines \u2013 can make or break the experiment.

Many of the universities \u2013 Illinois, Northwestern, (the University of) Chicago \u2013 come help build Chicago. I\u2019d say it\u2019s definitely on the upswing.\u201d\nGILBERT: \u201cI\u2019m from Chicago, I think Chicago\u2019s great. \u2026 I think for most of my career, I\u2019ve felt the inexorable pull of the Bay Area. And I feel like that\u2019s changing. So in Ann Arbor where I (live), you saw Duo Security get (started), stay there, exit, and continue to stay there.

Work your butt off. The idea that you can just go in and spend eight hours and \u2018I\u2019m balanced and I\u2019m more productive\u2019 is total baloney.\n\u201cGo wherever that best opportunity is. And then when you get into your mid-30s and you want to have a family, you want more balance, you want to spend time with kids, that\u2019s great. But you\u2019ve got your career foundation built.\u201d\nLASSNER: \u201cYou can do great work anywhere,\u201d citing the example of University of Hawaii Emeritus Professor Norman Abrahamson, who led the development of the ALOHAnet, the first wireless packet network, after beginning his career at Stanford University and the University of California-Berkeley.\n\u201cHe decided he wanted to move to Hawaii because he wanted to surf more, joined the Electrical Engineering Department, and invented the ALOHAnet.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlumni Awards Week\n\n\nIn addition to the panel and dinner and awards ceremony, honorees and students enjoyed a keynote address by Mark Tebbe (BS CS '83). (Watch the video.) He is chairman of ChicagoNEXT at World Business Chicago and an\u00a0adjunct professor of entrepreneurship\u00a0at the University of Chicago Booth\u00a0School of Business.\nAward winners enjoyed a working breakfast at the University of Illinois Research Park and your of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications\u2019 National Petascale Computing Facility.\nAs part of the awards weekend, the annual Women in Computer Science Alumni-Student Dinner was also held, including a keynote address by Rita Patel Jackson (BS Math and CS, \u201988). (Watch the video.) She is the head of global marketing for GE Healthcare\u2019s Healthcare Analytics organization.\n\n\nWHAT IS YOUR BEST METHOD FOR AVOIDING PROCRASTINATION?\nCYTRON: \u201cYou want a healthy balance in life, right? My son, who is now 20 years old, would get up from dinner, go play the piano, go play the ukulele, go play \u2018Fortnite\u2019 for a while. So the problem is you do that indefinitely to the effect of never getting your work done. The goal in life is, what you want to do and have to do become the same thing eventually.\u201d\nERLEBACHER: \u201cUsually the things that I procrastinate on were the things that were too big, they were daunting. So my suggestion is find a way to break it down into bits so you can have that satisfaction of, \u2018Oh, step one of five, I\u2019ve completed step one.\u2019 Just break it down into smaller problems. That\u2019s what we teach in computer science, right?\u201d\nPATEL JACKSON: \u201cSometimes (procrastination is) OK. I know how long physically, mentally it\u2019s going to take me to get things done, and I work well under pressure. And not everybody does. \u2026 So if you work good under pressure and you can get it done, it\u2019s good quality work, have at it.\u201d\n\nWHAT IS THE KEY TO PRODUCTIVE AND HAPPY TEAMWORK?\nGILBERT: \u201cI think it\u2019s a lot of psychology, actually. Go south of Green Street, take a psychology class.\n\u201cYou have to have a shared goal, you have to buy into the goal, you have to have trust with the people who are working that you\u2019re going to have their back \u2013 that if I need help you\u2019ll pitch in and help me, but it\u2019s going to be reciprocal.\u201d\nDHAR: \u201cI had an internship when I was a CS student here. I was pretty young, I think it was my first job ever. So I had an assignment and one day, I worked until around 6:30 or so, and most of the people had left. I decided \u2018OK, I\u2019m going to go home now.\u2019\n\u201cI walked back in the next morning and I had one of those moments that defined the rest of my career, where the person who was supervising me asked me to come in and we sat down. He said \u2018Is this thing done yet?\u2019 I said \u2018No, I\u2019m going to do it today.\u2019 He said, \u2018Listen, you didn\u2019t get your thing done, so nobody else on the team was able to do their work. Now they\u2019re waiting for you.\u2019\n\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t go home before 9 p.m. one more night that summer. But more to the point, what happens on teams is you let people own their work. If you really think about them as the owners, the people who make the team succeed, then you don\u2019t have to manage anybody. You let people manage themselves and everybody comes together and gets something done.\u201d\n"}, {"source": "University of Illinois", "title": "Adve\u2019s Research on Memory Consistency Models, Influence on Hardware and Software Worlds Recognized with Kennedy Award ", "link": "/news/adve-s-research-memory-consistency-models-influence-hardware-and-software-worlds-recognized", "date": "October 31, 2018", "content": "\nIllinois Computer Science Professor Sarita Adve has been named the recipient of the 2018 ACM/IEEE-CS Ken Kennedy Award by the Association for Computing Machinery and IEEE Computer Society. The award recognizes her influential work and leadership at the interface of hardware and software.\nAdve is the third Illinois CS professor to win the prestigious award in the past nine years, joining 2010 winner David J. Kuck and 2016 winner William D. Gropp.\nThe 2018 Kennedy Award, which was announced Oct. 31, recognizes Adve \u201cfor research contributions and leadership in the development of memory consistency models for C++ and Java, for service to numerous computer science organizations, and for exceptional mentoring.\u201d\nAdve, who is the Richard T. Cheng Professor of Computer Science, said the research behind the award began in her earliest work, at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where she earned a PhD in 1993.\n\u201cThis is an area I started working on as a grad student and continue to work on. That\u2019s quite unusual, but just happened to be a problem that was a really hard problem,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the reasons that it\u2019s hard is that this problem affects both hardware and software. \u2026 It\u2019s at the heart of the notion of correct behavior of a computer, and yet this is a part of that puzzle that has been really hard to solve.\u201d\nAdve co-developed the memory models for C++ and Java (with Hans Boehm, Bill Pugh, and others), based on her early work on data-race-free (DRF) models (with her PhD advisor, Mark Hill).\u00a0 The memory model specifies what value a read of a memory address will return, and is key to the correctness and performance of threaded programs, languages, compilers, and hardware. By impacting the models of the most widely used programming languages, Adve\u2019s work has influenced the worldwide software community and hardware design.\nBut she notes the idea did not take hold overnight.\n\u201cWe wrote the first paper in 1990,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was very well received. But it took a long time for people to really understand our idea that a memory model should be viewed as a contract between hardware and software where software obeys certain rules (data-race-free) and hardware promises sequential consistency. That this idea struck the sweet spot between programmability and performance took over a decade to really take hold.\u201d\nMore recently, with her students, Adve questioned the conventional wisdom for memory models for heterogeneous systems and showed that DRF is a superior model even for such systems.\nOne of the students who played a key role in that research was Matt Sinclair (PhD CS \u201917), now an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin.\n\u201cSarita is an excellent mentor, and I've benefited tremendously from the opportunity to work with her and learn from her,\u201d Sinclair said. \u201cIn particular, Sarita is really good at treating each person uniquely, and identifying the best way to mentor them and bring out their best.\u00a0 This is something I strive to emulate in my post-graduate career.\u201d\nAdve\u2019s broader research interests are at the hardware-software interface and span the system stack from hardware to applications. She is also known for her innovations in cache coherence, hardware reliability, and power management.\nPennsylvania State University Emeritus Professor and Illinois Computer Science graduate Mary Jane Irwin (MS CS \u201975, PhD \u201977) nominated Adve for the award and called her \"a natural and right choice,\" based on her teaching, mentoring, and community service, as well as the impact of her research.\n\"Sarita\u2019s long-term and impactful work on designing and formally specifying memory consistency models has had profound, real-world impact on programmability and productivity in computing,\" Irwin wrote. \"The memory consistency model lies at the heart of the semantics of any threaded software or hardware. Arguably, it has been one of the most challenging and contentious areas in concurrent hardware and software specification for many years.\"\nThe award also recognizes Adve, in part,\u00a0for her extensive service to the computing community.\n\u201cTo be a good researcher is not sufficient in my mind, we need to give back,\u201d she said.\nHer service includes working as the current chair of the ACM Special Interest Group on Computer Architecture (SIGARCH), where she instituted changes that have inspired new energy in the executive committee, leading to new programs in communications, research visioning, and mentoring. With colleagues, she also has made diversity and inclusion a key focus and led the creation of CARES, a committee to provide support to those who experienced harassment at SIGARCH and SIGMICRO sponsored events.\nAdve also serves on the ACM Council and the DARPA ISAT study group and previously served on the board of the Computing Research Association and the NSF CISE advisory committee.\nAdve is a recipient of the Anita Borg Institute Women of Vision award in innovation, the ACM SIGARCH Maurice Wilkes award, and an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship. She is a Fellow of the ACM and IEEE and was named a University Scholar by the University of Illinois.\nThe award will be presented at SC 18: The International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis, in Dallas, Texas on Nov. 13.\nKuck, who is an emeritus professor, won the 2010 Kennedy Award for \u201cpioneering contributions to compiler technology and parallel computing, the profound impact of his research on industry, and the widespread and long-lasting influence of his teaching and mentoring.\u201d Gropp, who is both the director of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications and the Thomas M. Siebel Chair in Computer Science, was recognized with the 2016 award for \u201chighly influential contributions to the programmability of high-performance parallel and distributed computers, and extraordinary service to the profession.\u201d\nACM and IEEE-CS co-sponsor the Kennedy Award, which was established in 2009 to recognize substantial contributions to programmability and productivity in computing and significant community service or mentoring contributions. It was named for the late Ken Kennedy, founder of Rice University\u2019s computer science program.\n"}, {"source": "University of Illinois", "title": "ThinkChicago Brings City\u2019s Tech Message and Leaders to Illinois CS Students ", "link": "/news/thinkchicago-brings-city-s-tech-message-and-leaders-illinois-cs-students", "date": "October 31, 2018", "content": "\nFrom his office in downtown Chicago, Steve Benni leads a team of technologists for JP Morgan Chase & Co.

You talk to people who live in Silicon Valley and they\u2019re on the bus an hour and a half,\u201d Benni, the financial firm\u2019s executive director of global technology, said during the ThinkChicago Roadshow on Oct. 25. \u201cI love competing against my peers in JP Morgan. We can beat them on all these metrics.\u201d\nBenni (BS CS \u201800) was part of a panel of tech executives and entrepreneurs who talked to students during the Roadshow stop at Illinois Computer Science.\nThe Roadshow holds events at college campuses around the state and beyond, working to spread the message of ThinkChicago \u2013 the public-private partnership that works to develop the city\u2019s technology sector -- and encouraging students to explore the professional possibilities the city holds.\nThe Roadshow stop at Illinois CS offered students the chance to connect with representatives of a number of top Chicago-area companies and the opportunity to listen to a panel of tech leaders talk about the city and the resources it offers.\nIn Benni\u2019s case, he told students that Chicago gives him both the career he wants with JP Morgan and the ability to live nearby with his family.\n\u201cI live about a mile and a half from our office in downtown Chicago, and I\u2019m very much a Chicagoan at heart,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve raised my kids in the city.\u201d\nLike Benni, Chicago is both home and a professional advantage for Joe Jablonski.\nJablonski (BS EE \u201893) is the co-founder and CTO of Ocient, a data analytics startup, and a veteran of other area tech startups.\n\u201cWe hire a ton of young engineers, and they all walk or bike to work,\u201d he told students. \u201cThat is an amazing lifestyle.\u201d\nBut Chicago provides advantages to the company beyond a nice way of life for employees, Jablonski said.\nThe past successes of Jablonski and his co-founders \u2013 including the $1.3 billion sale of Cleversafe, which two of them were part of -- meant they could have started Ocient anywhere, but chose Chicago, he said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s one overwhelming reason, and that\u2019s because of the talent that\u2019s in Chicago,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s worth working there and living there for that reason.\u201d\nAnd Ocient is making the most of the region\u2019s talent. About 75 percent of the 21 employees and interns it hired last summer came from the University of Illinois.\nChicago also has a strong track record of founders who have chosen to remain in the city, and a pool of financing that makes more possible, Jablonski said.\n\u201cIn 2004, me and some buddies started a poker game,\u201d he said. \u201cThat group (included) the founders of Grubhub, the founders of Groupon, the founders of Cleversafe, and myself,\u201d he said. \u201cAt Ocient we probably had 50 venture capitalists begging us to put money into Ocient. It really isn\u2019t a problem.\u201d\nMuch of the discussion also focused on hiring. Most of the members of the panel emphasized that they\u2019re looking for people who are skilled technologists and data scientists, but also have broader aspirations.\n\u201cAre you a good cultural fit? Are you passionate? I don\u2019t want somebody who chose engineering just because they wanted to make a lot of money,\u201d said Miranda Kemp, who is director of AARP\u2019s technology labs at the University of Illinois Research Park. She is also a University of Illinois MBA student.\nLong Hei, who is director of Data Science for CCC Information Services in Chicago, said data science comes first when he hires, but \u201cI\u2019m looking for people who want to put on other hats, not just data science hats, but think about the users -- what do they want?\u201d\n\u201cA good data scientist should be trilingual,\u201d he added, able to dive into math, technology, and business.\nBeth Ladd, who is analytics R&D manager and director of the Caterpillar Data Innovation Lab and CAT Digital Lab at the Research Park, looks for students with a similarly varied skill set.\n\u201cWe want folks who are curious, love technology, who are interested in human-centered design,\u201d she said.\nBut at Benni\u2019s group, he said, a love of technology is key.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m looking for is somebody who really wants a career in technology, 10 years from now is still going to be doing something technical.\u201d\n"}, {"source": "University of Illinois", "title": "New Center to Accelerate Quantum Information Science and Engineering ", "link": "/news/new-center-accelerate-quantum-information-science-and-engineering", "date": "October 29, 2018", "content": "\nThe University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is making a $15 million investment in the emerging area of quantum information science and engineering, a field poised to revolutionize computing, communication, security, measurement and sensing by utilizing the unique and powerful capabilities of quantum mechanics.\nThe centerpiece of the campus effort will be the formation of the Illinois Quantum Information Science and Technology Center.\u00a0 This will include a major hiring initiative to expand the number of quantum science experts at Illinois across multiple departments throughout the\u00a0College of Engineering\u00a0and the campus. \u00a0The center will also enable the development of a focused program to educate the next-generation quantum workforce.\u00a0 The investment will also include state-of-the-art equipment for the fabrication of quantum materials and devices.\u00a0\nThe center will bring together Illinois\u2019 physicists, engineers, computer scientists and many others to develop new paradigms in quantum information science and technology.

But three Illinois Computer Science professors believe improvements could be found in the inefficiencies of computing systems, and the National Science Foundation believes their idea holds some promise.\nThe NSF has awarded a $1.2 million, four-year grant to Professors Josep Torrellas, Laxmikant V. Kale, and David Padua to work on ways to make existing systems consistently more efficient, which they believe could exponentially improve performance of large servers and data centers. Torrellas is the principal investigator for the project, for which the three will collaborate with chip-maker Advanced Micro Devices.\nThe bottom line, Torrellas said, is CMOS-based computers use energy very inefficiently, for a variety of reasons.\nData has to be gathered from the memory, other chips, or the disk, requiring far more energy than would be used if all operations were performed locally on the processor, he said.\nSecond, many operations use an approach called speculation that consumes a lot of energy and, in many instances, are just plain useless, according to Torrellas.\n\u201cLet\u2019s say a program executes, and hits a branch. The program\u00a0needs to check a condition to decide which way to go. But processors do not wait to figure out the outcome of the condition before moving on because it\u2019s going to take some time,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead the processor follows one path. Then, if that\u2019s wrong, the hardware scraps everything, and goes the other way.\u201d\nAnd finally, using his own office laptop as a small-scale example as it idled nearby, \u201cThis guy is consuming a lot of energy not doing anything,\u201d Torrellas said.\n\u201cSo the combination of these three things make a computer orders of magnitude less efficient than it should be.\u201d\nTorrellas is the Saburo Muroga Professor of Computer Science and his research focuses on architecture, compilers, and parallel computing.\nHe and his collaborators are taking a four-pronged approach to the project:\n\nAdapting control theory \u2013 which is used across engineering to analyze systems and create feedback loops used to control those systems -- to computer architecture.\nDeveloping hardware controllers.\nExtending runtime systems to actuate on the hardware.\nUsing compilers to generate code that is optimal for a highly-controlled cluster or datacenter.\n\nControl theory, Torrellas explained, presents an early unknown in the project. It is often used in aeronautical engineering and mechanical engineering.\n\u201cHow can it be applied to computers? It is an open question,\u201d he said. \u201cComputers are very complicated; building a model of a computer is very hard.\u201d\nThe key, he said, will be to take what he calls an integrated, cross-layer approach to the work.\n\u201cThere\u2019s hardware, the operating system, the compiler, the application,\u201d Torrellas said. \u201cAll these layers, if you optimize them together, you get a higher impact.\u201d\nTorrellas will focus on the hardware.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a large machine built out of nodes, each node will have multiple chips, each chip will have multiple cores,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to build in a hierarchical manner. You control the core, then you control the chip that has multiple cores. Then you have a node that controls multiple chips, and so on.\u201d\nKale, meanwhile, will work on the runtime system. Kale is the Paul and Cynthia Saylor Professor of Computer Science and leads the Parallel Programming Laboratory. His past work includes pioneering research to develop adaptive runtime systems in parallel computing.\n\u201cPower, energy, and temperature are becoming very important issues in extreme-scale computing, even as they are important on cellphones and laptops,\u201d Kale said. \u201cIt is an exciting prospect to combine our work on adaptive runtime systems with controllable adaptive hardware at the lower level and compiler support at higher level, via a common framework provided by a control system.\u201d\nPadua is a Donald Biggar Willett Professor in Engineering and his research focus includes optimization strategies. He will focus on designing compilers.\nThe three professors also plan to compare the use of control theory to improve system efficiency with the use of machine learning.\n\u201cSome people are trying to make the systems more efficient by using machine learning -- an algorithm that\u2019s telling me \u2018shut this hardware down now\u2019 or \u2018move this program here, change the frequency,\u2019 as opposed to control theory, which is based on a more reactive approach,\u201d Torrellas said.\nTorrellas, Kale and Padua also believe the project could serve as a catalyst for interdisciplinary research and education on clusters and data-center technology at Illinois.\n"}, {"source": "University of Illinois", "title": "Siebel Chair Gift Keeps Giving To Gropp And Illinois CS Researchers ", "link": "/news/siebel-chair-gift-keeps-giving-gropp-and-illinois-cs-researchers", "date": "October 12, 2018", "content": "\nAs a young researcher, Bill Gropp worked in a world where scientists with bright ideas could find the funding to explore them before they had any results in hand.\nThat world has radically changed, Gropp says, requiring researchers to have at least some promising findings before they can secure the money to see their ideas through.\nBut as the Thomas M. Siebel Chair in Computer Science, Professor Gropp has a tool that lets him sometimes turn back the clock.\nThe chair gives Gropp money he can use at his discretion to launch the kind of \u201ccuriosity-driven research\u201d that he says often leads to truly transformative ideas.\n\u201cIt\u2019s seed money \u2013 incredibly valuable seed money,\u201d said Gropp, who is also director of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. \u201cThis is what\u2019s really valuable with the resources that come with the chair. It gives you this opportunity to explore without having to wedge it into your grant funding or finding some other way to do it on a shoestring.\u201d\nThe Siebel Chair in Computer Science was established in 2013 with a $2 million gift from the Thomas and Stacey Siebel Foundation, the charitable organization established by Illinois Computer Science alumnus Thomas Siebel (BA History \u201975, MBA \u201983, MS CS \u201985).\nSiebel, who is the chairman and CEO of enterprise software company C3 IoT and before that founded Siebel Systems, is an active philanthropist. The foundation supports efforts related to everything from energy solutions and public health to caring for the homeless.\nThe Siebel Chair reflects two of Siebel\u2019s other philanthropic passions: research and education.\nDiscussing his long history of major gifts to the University of Illinois, Siebel told The News-Gazette in 2014 that the guiding philosophy for philanthropy is \"Make change happen.\"\nGropp became the first Siebel Chair after coming to the university from Argonne National Laboratory in 2007. He had a track record of pioneering the kind of change Siebel talked about. Gropp and collaborators designed the Message Passing Interface, or MPI, the standard that is essential to the parallel processing now at the heart of supercomputing.\nGropp came to Illinois Computer Science as the Paul and Cynthia Saylor Professor in Computer Science, a position that provided him with resources and possibilities beyond the typical faculty position.\nThe Siebel Chair gives Gropp even more, including links to Siebel\u2019s other on-campus endeavors \u2013 the Siebel Scholars and the new Siebel Center for Design.\n\u201cPart of having that chair is interacting with these other things,\u201d Gropp said. \u201cI\u2019ve had some really good discussions with Rachel Switzky, the new head of the Siebel Design Center.\u201d\nAnd, in the bottom-line research world Gropp talked about, the chair provided greater financial resources.\n\u201cI do have more flexibility in saying I can absolutely afford a student on this for a couple of years. \u2026 I just don\u2019t have to worry about it,\u201d Gropp said.\nErin Molloy is one of several students now working on projects started at least in part with money from the Siebel Chair.

As the changes are integrated, regression tests are run to find out whether changes introduce bugs into the code.\n\u201cDevelopers do these actions typically several times per day. It can take anywhere from five, 10 minutes to literally hours (for each),\u201d Marinov said. \u201cIf this thing is going to take two hours to give them the result back, they\u2019re just going to idle -- they\u2019re going to start reading emails, go on the web.

A new book tells the stories of 12 of them.\n\u201cWomen and Ideas in Engineering: Twelve Stories From Illinois\u201d was written by Laura D. Hahn, the director of the university\u2019s Academy for Excellence in Engineering Education, and Angela S. Wolters, director of Women in Engineering for the university.\nThe book includes stories of key figures from Computer Science, among them Google Director of Engineering for Chrome Parisa Tabriz, PhD graduate and former Adjunct Teaching Professor Cinda Heeren \u2013 who wrote her own reflections on computing and teaching -- and Professor Geneva Belford.\n\"Geneva was tough and practical, yet energetic and generous with her time,\u201d said one of Belford\u2019s most well-known students, C3 IoT CEO and founder Thomas M. Siebel.\nThe book is available from the University of Illinois Press. The authors also invite readers to follow as more stories of women engineers are posted at the college\u2019s Women in Engineering website.\nExcerpts from the book:\n\nGeneva Belford \n1932-20l4, PhD Math \u201860\nShe advised more than 140 graduate students, and toward the end of her career, she helped scores of additional students through her role as the graduate program coordinator in the CS Department.\nAccording to CS Professor Roy Campbell, Geneva was unique because she regularly advised masters-level students while most faculty members preferred working with doctoral-level candidates. \"She was always very welcoming and provided support for many students [interested] in distributed systems and networking,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cShe also took on a few atypical students, who didn't have a CS background.\u201d\nOne of those students was Tom Siebel (BA History, 1975), who entered the CS master's program in 1983 while working on an MBA at Illinois. He earned his MS in CS in 1985 and went on to found Siebel Systems, a customer relationship management (CRM) firm that was later acquired by Oracle for $5.8 billion. In 2014, Siebel described his CS experience as a life-changing event. \"Geneva was tough and practical, yet energetic and generous with her time,\u201d Siebel said in a video tribute to his advisor when she won a 2012 CS department service award. \"She encouraged exploration, experimentation and creativity. She was an important catalyst in my professional career.\u201d\n\nCinda Heeren\nSenior instructor in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia, PhD CS \u201804\n\u201cI've loved computing for decades but my perceptions of the craft of designing algorithms and writing code have changed in a very subtle way in just the last few years. \u2026\n\u201cA few years ago, partly because I missed my Grammy, I picked up my knitting needles and searched for a project of appropriate scope and beauty. What I found instead was a connection to computing that I didn\u2019t expect: the language paradigms used to describe knitting patterns and procedures (are) composed of exactly the same elements as that of C++ or Python or any other modern computing language. Iteration, abstraction, conditionals, and the stitches themselves form a configuration analogous to some kind of data structure. I am not the first one to have made this observation, but it has created in me a new sensitivity to the ways in which handcraft is communicated, and most poignantly, it reinforces the idea that computing constructs are more general in their application to computing devices.\n\u201cSomewhat later, in the summer of 2013, I spent one day in a textile museum in Guatemala City, Guatemala. My earlier observations about the knitting patterns were reinforced, and I was increasingly touched, because the art of weaving is hundreds of years old and yet the handicraft itself illustrates these same computing constructs. \u2026\n\u201cThe computing of today has its roots in traditions of handcraft, art, and music, and the minute we all admit that fact, we have the ability to break down barriers. With this in mind, I will infuse my teaching with these connections and broaden the historical view of our field, primarily because I do not want artificial barriers to participation. Besides, arts and crafts are beautiful and expressive and human.\u201d\n\nParisa Tabriz\nGoogle Director of Engineering for Chrome, BS CS \u201904, MS \u201806\nWhen she needed to print business cards for a security conference she was attending in Japan, she chose Security Princess \u2026 not because Parisa is \"the princess type\" -- she's practical and down-to-earth -- but because it was \u201ccute and a bit more whimsical.\u201d There's irony there, too. Parisa proudly acknowledges being a woman in a field dominated by men. \u2026\n\u2026\nForbes included her on its 2013 \u201c30 under 30\u201d list of tech pioneers, Wired named her to the 2017 List of 20 Tech Visionaries who are Creating the Future, \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d has profiled her, and she's been featured in the popular media.

Am I doing this?' And I think women struggle with that [uncertainty] much more.\u201d\nBy candidly sharing her college and career experiences, Paris a hopes to dispel some of the myths she feels exist about studying computer science and finding careers in high tech. \u201cI didn't have this passion or this drive to know what I wanted to do, and I also didn't start programming until my freshman year.

Hart, the director of Online and Professional Programs in Illinois Computer Science, and casts the department as a leader in online programs.\nThe full report, \u201cOn-Ramps and Off-Ramps: Alternative Credentials and Emerging Pathways Between Education and Work,\u201d sits behind a pay wall, but in this excerpt, Hart discusses what students can expect from the online program:\n\u00a0\nMuch of the action with alternative credentials and pathways is occurring with online graduate programs. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is at the forefront of this experimentation and now offers three master\u2019s degrees through the online platform from Coursera, the MOOC provider. The university\u2019s master\u2019s of computer science and business administration (the iMBA) have the largest enrollments of any graduate program at the university.\nPotential students can take two open online courses on Coursera as an introduction to the degree programs, says John C. Hart, a professor of computer science at Illinois and director of online and professional programs in computer science. Those course bundles serve as an admissions funnel for capable working adults.\nThe three Coursera degree programs, which include elements of self-pacing for students who work full-time, are priced at $21,000 in total tuition and fees, roughly half the price of their campus-based equivalents. But faculty members teach the online version with equal rigor to the parallel campus-based version.\n\u201cThey\u2019re teaching the same material at the same level with the same academic rigor,\u201d says Hart.\n\u00a0\nThe report also devotes some reporting to the Gies College of Business\u2019 iMBA and its financial details:\nThe University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign began its fully online iMBA with Coursera in 2016. The same university faculty members teach both the online and campus-based versions. But the iMBA\u2019s total price is $22,000, with tuition of $250 per credit, compared to the more than $57,618 in tuition and fees that in-state students enrolled in the university\u2019s residential M.B.A. program can expect to pay, and the $82,026 in tuition for out-of-state students. Applicants to the iMBA also are not required to take the GMAT or GRE.\nIllinois also offers online versions of master\u2019s degrees in computer science and accountancy on Coursera. And earlier this year, a first cohort of 76 students graduated from the iMBA program, which enrolled 1,600 students this spring. The program\u2019s retention rate was 92 percent, according to the university. Its average student is 37 years old with 12 years of work experience. \u00a0\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going in debt,\u201d says Ray Schroeder of the University of Illinois at Springfield, who is also founding director of the National Council for Online Education at the University Professional and Continuing Education Association (UPCEA).\u00a0 He predicts substantial growth in MOOC-powered graduate programs because they are accessible, affordable and tend to be demand driven. \n\u201cIt\u2019s really teaching at scale, using technology,\u201d says Schroeder. \u201cThey\u2019ve got all the pieces.\u201d\nExperts say Coursera and edX can skim smaller percentage fees than traditional OPMs do from the online programs they run with colleges. Spruce Point Capital Management, an investment firm that has a short-selling position on 2U, used a public records request to find that Illinois pays a 40 percent tuition revenue fee to Coursera, less than the 60 percent or more OPMs historically have charged. MOOC platforms also will have a head start on short-term master\u2019s programs if those credentials take off. So will highly selective universities, Schroeder says, both with alternative and more conventional online graduate programs. \n\u201cThe large universities have the resources to capitalize on these ventures,\u201d he says, adding that a graduate degree market shift could be hard on vulnerable public and private colleges. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones who are really going to be hurt.\u201d\n\u00a0\n"}, {"source": "University of Illinois", "title": "Illinois Computer Science Honors Achievements of 13 Alumni and Faculty ", "link": "/news/illinois-computer-science-honors-achievements-13-alumni-and-faculty", "date": "September 18, 2018", "content": "\nIllinois Computer Science will hold its eighth annual Alumni Awards Ceremony and Banquet on\u00a0October 19, recognizing 13 alumni and faculty who have made professional, technical, educational, or service contributions that bring distinction to themselves, the department, and the university.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf you know of an outstanding CS alumnus who deserves\u00a0recognition, make sure that the department knows!

He wanted to get an advanced degree and needed to get to work as soon as he could.\nBut in his 18 months at Illinois, MacGregor (MS CS \u201980) found more than a path to a job. He found tools and support that would steer him onto the winding, rewarding road he\u2019s still on today.\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t too many straight lines,\u201d MacGregor said, laughing about his unconventional path, one that as of this year includes an Illinois CS Distinguished Alumni Achievement Award.\nHe ventured to the then-developing tech hub in Austin, Texas, then to Japan \u2013 for school and work \u2013 and on to Colorado, Boston, and Austin (again), before landing in his current home, Western State Colorado University in the Rocky Mountains.\nAlong the way, he worked for Motorola and Dell Computer, co-founded a joint venture with Matsushita, and earned his PhD at Kyoto University, one of the first Americans to do so. He also co-owned an Arena Football League team (it failed), and went back to school in his 60s to add another master\u2019s degree (he succeeded, graduating in 2017 from Johns Hopkins).\nTwo Illinois CS professors in particular helped MacGregor find his way, and he has never forgotten them and their key roles in his success.\nMacGregor provided the gift to Illinois Computer Science that endowed both the Saburo Muroga Professorship in Computer Science and the Michael Faiman Professorship in Computer Science.\nFaiman was MacGregor\u2019s thesis advisor, and pointed him toward a project that involved Motorola\u2019s 68000 series of microprocessors.\nBut when Motorola came to campus to recruit, the company mistakenly bypassed CS students, MacGregor said. That changed with a call from Muroga.\n\u201cSo his proactive concern about a student is actually how my whole career got launched,\u201d MacGregor said.\nHe would eventually land a job and become the microcoder and micromachine architect for Motorola's MC68010 and MC68020. Based on that work, MacGregor was awarded 24 patents and the IEEE Browder J. Thompson Memorial Prize Paper Award.\nA few years later, when MacGregor was drawn to Japan with the idea that he would either work or go back to school, Muroga again offered a guiding hand, suggesting he do both.\n\u201cHe called up some professors at Kyoto University,\u201d MacGregor said. \u201cMy oral exam and thesis presentation were five hours of the worst Japanese ever spoken.\u201d\nAfter MacGregor returned to the United States he became a vice president of products and procurement at Dell back in Austin. When he left Dell, he joined Harvard Business School as a research fellow focused leadership, after which another sort of opportunity came along, part-ownership of the Austin Wranglers in the now-defunct Arena Football League.\nThe team folded after just a few seasons for a simple reason, according to MacGregor \u2013 \u201cThe expenses were greater than the revenue.\u201d\nHe called the experience a lot of fun, and \u201ca good lesson in humility for me.\u201d\nMost recently, MacGregor found his own calling to teach. An adjunct professor, he created the cybersecurity program at Western State Colorado University in Gunnison.\nBut he believed he needed a technical refresher, and enrolled in the online master\u2019s program at Johns Hopkins, studying cybersecurity.\nAfter years of working in management, \u201cit doesn\u2019t take long before you\u2019re out of shape technically,\u201d MacGregor said.\nNow at a school focused entirely on teaching, he looks back on the degree to which Muroga and Faiman, both serious researchers, made themselves available as teachers, too.\n\u201cThey were never stingy with their time in terms of the teaching aspect,\u201d MacGregor said.\n\u00a0\n"}]}
